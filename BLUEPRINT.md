# 📘 COMPHONE SUPER APP — BLUEPRINT (Single Source of Truth)

> **Version:** v5.18.47-sprint221 (PWA) / GAS Backend v5.18.23-line-signed-raw (@636)

> **Date:** 2026-07-21 | **Phase:** 221 (PO Acceptance + Signed LINE Raw Forwarding)

> **Status:** RECOVERED + HARDENED + FUNCTIONALLY AUDITED + PROTECTED-LIVE-VERIFIED + DATA-IDENTITY-HARDENED + REAL-AI-VISION-VERIFIED - Sprint 220 completed controlled PO production write acceptance and cleanup. Sprint 221 fixes the LINE signature-breaking Worker payload rewrite, makes GAS signature validation fail closed, and removes active-source LINE credentials/room identifiers. GAS `v5.18.23-line-signed-raw` is live at @636; Worker `1.0.6-sprint221` is the release candidate pending GitHub deployment verification. Historical detail remains below.

## Agent Handoff Snapshot (READ FIRST)

This section is the latest handoff for any human or AI agent continuing COMPHONE work.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 211-212 baseline: the 15-step system test passes 167/167.
> Sprint 212 Auth-Aware Startup remains the historical startup safety gate.
> Sprint 212 prevents the warranty module from calling protected APIs before
> authentication, makes Background Sync demand-driven only when an offline queue
> contains work, and wires Sprint 211/212 into the static, regression, and CI gates.
> Current frontend build token: `20260721_1541`.
> Live protected browser acceptance and real LINE image evidence remain operational
> verification items, not completed solely by static tests.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 213 Protected Menu Collision: protected production browser
> acceptance confirmed PC menu data and Mobile CRM, Inventory, Billing, Reports,
> AI Vision, and LINE Center. Mobile Jobs detail failed because the later-loaded
> CRM module redefined global `showJobDetail`; CRM now uses `showCrmJobDetail` and
> delegates to the canonical Jobs renderer. PC Mobile links open a separate tab so
> the intentional before-unload protection does not block the handoff. Mobile
> before-unload now treats `[]` as an empty offline queue and warns only when
> unsynced actions actually exist. Service Worker base paths now derive from
> registration scope so localhost, staging, and GitHub Pages execute the same SW.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 214 CI observability: the regression guard emits native
> GitHub Actions error/warning annotations while preserving the same blocking
> rules. This makes individual CI failures available through check-run
> annotations even when raw workflow logs require GitHub authentication.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 215 Data Identity Integrity: a controlled production write
> lifecycle exposed JobID reuse after deletion. Job ID generation now maintains
> a Script Properties high-water mark and scans live, archive, billing, status,
> warranty, and photo references before allocating the next ID. Billing lists no
> longer assume Billing_ID is column zero, and smoke cleanup owns a namespaced
> header matcher. The generated smoke customer/job were archived and deleted;
> all smoke-tagged customer, job, and billing rows are archived/deleted after
> controlled verification.

> Sprint 215 live follow-up: GAS `v5.18.17-id-integrity` is deployed at @626.
> The repaired billing list exposed two smoke-tagged billing rows. Cleanup plan
> primary-key selection is now scope-aware so billing cleanup sends Billing_ID,
> never Job_ID, to the protected archive/delete action.

> Cleanup diagnostics now report only resolved sheet identity, row count, and ID
> header metadata so schema-routing failures can be diagnosed without exposing
> business row values.

> Live diagnostics found both legacy `Bill_ID` and canonical `Billing_ID` in
> DB_BILLING. Cleanup header resolution now honors candidate priority and selects
> canonical `Billing_ID` before legacy aliases regardless of physical column order.

> JobID allocation also scans `DB_SMOKE_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE` and
> `DB_DATA_REPAIR_ARCHIVE`; deleted identifiers remain permanently reserved even
> after their live billing/reference rows have been cleaned.

> Cleanup safety closure: prior write-smoke report IDs are historical hints only,
> never live deletion candidates. Both planner and backend now no-op when no live
> records are selected; the former hardcoded fallback deletion list is removed.

> Cleanup now invalidates current dashboard cache keys (`dashboard_data_v89` and
> `dashboard_bundle_v61`) plus targeted Jobs search caches. Deleted records no
> longer remain visible as ghost candidates until cache expiry.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 216 Current Gemini Vision + Large Payload Transport: the
> production fixture exposed two independent defects. Base64 images exceeded a
> reliable GET URL length, and every active AI caller still used
> `gemini-2.0-flash`, which Google shut down on 2026-06-01. Browser and smoke
> clients now switch payloads over 7,000 URL characters to JSON carried as
> `text/plain` POST, preserving simple GAS CORS behavior. Gemini model selection
> is centralized through `GEMINI_MODEL` with safe default `gemini-3.5-flash`;
> LINE Agent, Inventory Reorder, and Vision use the same endpoint helper.

> Vision Pipeline v1.1.2 now records safe provider/model/status/fallback metadata,
> does not cache provider errors, separates an AI failure from a real analysis,
> and uses a COMPHONE-specific prompt for phone/computer/CCTV/network/field work.
> The real-sample acceptance gate requires semantic evidence rather than HTTP 200.
> Production fixture `test_fixtures/vision/cracked_phone_workbench_640.jpg` passed
> most recently at `VISION_LOG row-12`: provider `google-gemini`, model `gemini-3.5-flash`,
> confidence 0.95, asset `phone`, category `Before`, decision `QC_FAIL`.
> No real LINE message was sent by this controlled pilot. The equivalent parser
> syntax was made CI-validator-safe and GAS is live at @630.
> CI consumes only the secret-free release evidence in
> `test_reports/sprint216_ai_vision_production_evidence.json`; detailed live
> reports remain ignored local artifacts and cannot leak session material.
> Tokenless CI also keeps Sprint 170 deterministic: its nested protected sweep
> records live reads as SKIP, while the primary smoke suite remains responsible
> for public health/version probes. This removes duplicate production network
> calls without weakening the release contract.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 217 LINE Quiet Mode + Alert Rendering: production browser
> inspection found configured rooms already had outbound notifications muted,
> while bot replies were still enabled. LINE notification and bot-reply settings
> remain independent: muting either output never disables webhook processing,
> Vision logs, queues, or audit records. LINE Center now formats nested alert
> payloads without rendering `[object Object]`, keeps Thai command/help text in
> valid UTF-8, and has a dedicated recurrence guard wired into regression and CI.
> GAS `v5.18.19-line-quiet-center` was deployed at @631. Protected production
> verification set bot replies OFF for all nine room roles; all five configured
> rooms report notifications OFF and bot replies OFF. Backend processing remains
> active by contract. Production browser evidence follows after Pages publishes
> build `20260721_1449`.

> Sprint 217 release automation also moves every repository workflow from
> `actions/checkout@v4` / `actions/setup-node@v4` to the current v6 action
> runtime. This removes the Node 20 action-runtime deprecation warning while
> preserving the application's explicit test matrix and Node version choices.

> Sprint 217 validation: static guard, CI readiness, GAS alignment/syntax,
> Sprint 217 quiet-mode guard, Sprint 215 identity guard, and the complete
> regression pack pass. The system step test remains 167/167 with zero warnings.
> Worker `1.0.5-sprint189` health and `/diag/gas` both pass; the diagnostic
> confirms GAS, Gemini, and LINE readiness without sending a real LINE message.

> CI follow-up: the first Sprint 217 workflow run reached Guard Self-Test and
> correctly rejected the intentionally changed regression guard because its
> integrity checksum still described Sprint 216. The checksum is refreshed in
> the patch release; this is integrity metadata only and does not weaken any
> guard rule.

> Sprint 217 release closure: patch commit `5e7b808` passed Auto Deploy workflow
> #609. Validate Code, Deploy PWA to GitHub Pages, and Auto Tag Release all
> completed successfully. Remote Pages verification confirms Mobile and PC load
> `v5.18.47-sprint217` build `20260721_1449`, and the published LINE Center asset
> contains the nested-alert formatter. A fresh protected production smoke passed
> all required reads: health, version, Dashboard, CRM, Inventory, PO, Reports,
> Billing, Vision, LINE Center, room status, and Admin Security. No write-smoke
> records and no real LINE messages were created during this closure.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 218 Service Worker Update Click Race: production acceptance
> exposed an installed-client edge case. A version mismatch could show the update
> banner before the new worker reached `waiting`; tapping immediately reloaded the
> old build. The update button now calls `registration.update()` first, activates
> an existing waiting worker, observes an installing worker until it is ready,
> shows progress, and retains repair/reload fallbacks. A dedicated recurrence
> guard is wired into local regression and CI.

> Sprint 218 legacy-client bridge: `version_config.js` is network-only even for
> supported older workers, so it now captures the update-button action before a
> cached legacy `pwa_install.js` can reload too early. It requests the worker
> update, waits for `waiting`/`installed`, sends `SKIP_WAITING`, and reloads on
> controller change. Current `pwa_install.js` delegates to the same bridge.

> Sprint 218 release closure: commit `03a4e68` passed Auto Deploy workflow #611
> (Validate, Pages deploy, and Auto Tag all successful). Remote Pages verification
> confirms build `20260721_1524` and the published network-only version asset
> contains both the legacy-client bridge and capture handler. One browser-control
> profile that had remained open since Sprint 216 stayed pinned to its old service
> worker despite the published bridge; treat a one-time tab close/reopen or hard
> refresh as an operational migration step for already-stuck clients. New/current
> clients are protected by the Sprint 218 update flow and recurrence guard.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 219 Controlled Production Write + Complete Cleanup: the
> existing write smoke creates Customer, Job, Billing, Job status timeline, and
> Customer history evidence. Parent cleanup already archived Customer/Job/Billing
> rows, but could leave `DB_JOB_LOGS` and `DB_CUSTOMER_LOGS` children. Cleanup now
> derives child ownership only from parent rows that passed the smoke-marker gate
> and were actually deleted, archives every matching child before deletion, and
> preserves `DB_ACTIVITY_LOG` as immutable audit evidence. The real write lifecycle
> ran against GAS @632: 14/14 write/read/idempotency checks passed for Customer,
> Job, notes, status transition, timeline, and Billing. Cleanup archived and
> removed all three generated parent rows plus 24 matching Job/Customer history
> children; a second live scan found zero remaining smoke candidates. Purchase
> Order writes remain excluded from this acceptance because they require a
> separate high-risk owner gate. Secret-free evidence is recorded in
> `test_reports/sprint219_controlled_write_production_evidence.json`.

> Sprint 219 LINE/Vision readiness recheck passed 8/8 ingress checks and 17/17
> quiet-routing checks. Worker `/diag/gas` reports GAS, Gemini, and LINE ready;
> pending photo queue is zero. This proves the deployed processing path is ready,
> but no new real LINE image was sent during this controlled release, so a fresh
> owner-room image remains an external operational acceptance step.

> Sprint 219 release closure: commit `e9a8850` passed Auto Deploy workflow
> #612, GAS Deploy workflow #159, and GitHub Pages deployment #786. Remote Pages
> serves build `20260721_1541` / cache
> `comphone-v5.18.47-sprint219-20260721_1541`; the legacy-client update bridge
> remains present. A fresh production login then passed every required protected
> read in the API smoke: Dashboard, CRM, Inventory, PO, Reports, Billing, Vision,
> LINE Center/room status, and Admin Security. Sprint 185 also passed 17/17 with
> live ingress status. The repository was clean after these checks.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 220 Purchase Order Write Safety: production review found
> `createPurchaseOrder` lacked idempotency and used a random ID while list reads
> could return stale cache. The backend now serializes writes with ScriptLock,
> stores `Client_Request_ID` for durable replay, allocates collision-safe daily
> high-water IDs while honoring the cleanup archive, revisions PO list caches on
> every mutation, records create audit metadata, and lets acceptance suppress
> outbound LINE notification. The gated production lifecycle on GAS @634 passed
> 6/6: create, same-request replay, immediate readback, cleanup marker preview,
> archive-first delete, and post-cleanup absence. No test PO remains live.
> Secret-free evidence is in
> `test_reports/sprint220_po_write_production_evidence.json`.

> 2026-07-21 Sprint 221 Signed LINE Raw Forwarding: the Worker previously removed
> group `replyToken` values before forwarding while retaining LINE's signature
> from the original body. Because LINE HMAC covers the exact request bytes, GAS
> could reject genuine group events. Worker 1.0.6 forwards the byte-equivalent
> raw body and delegates reply suppression to per-room GAS toggles. It rejects a
> missing signature, optionally validates HMAC at the edge when its secret is
> configured, and GAS always performs final fail-closed validation. A synthetic
> local signature test proves missing/invalid rejection and exact-body forwarding.
> Production GAS @636 rejects a forged signature; Script Properties report LINE
> token and secret configured and five rooms remain configured.

> Photo queue schema now records `Source` (`LINE` or `PC`) and ingress diagnostics
> report source counts and latest LINE timestamp. The historical single queue row
> predates this field and is therefore `unknown`; it is not accepted as real LINE
> evidence. A new real room image after Worker publication remains the final
> external acceptance event. Active GAS sources no longer contain LINE access
> tokens, channel secrets, admin user IDs, or room-ID fallbacks; values are read
> from Script Properties only. Rotate credentials that ever appeared in Git
> history even though current source no longer contains them.

> Cowork review on or after 2026-06-12 should begin with
> `COWORK_SYSTEM_HANDOFF.md`. It separates current verified state, live-proof
> gaps, safety gates, and the recommended review order from the historical
> detail retained in this BLUEPRINT.

> 2026-06-15 runtime root-cause fix: owner reported menus felt
> "incomplete/inconsistent" despite a healthy backend. Live checks confirmed
> GAS health/login/Pages/Worker all OK; the real defect was **corrupted Thai
> (mojibake)** introduced by commit `9749fef` in two loaded PWA scripts
> (`section_revenue.js` = Revenue menu on mobile+PC, `dashboard_pc_core.js` =
> PC logout dialog). Correct Thai was reconstructed from clean `0b2856f` while
> keeping current logic; orphan `advanced_reports.js` (not loaded) was left and
> flagged. New `scripts/thai_encoding_guard.js` (in pre-commit + regression
> guard) blocks the `เธ` bigram and C1 control bytes from regressing. Deeper
> per-menu data/workflow completeness still needs a live `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`
> sweep. Details in `COWORK_SYSTEM_HANDOFF.md` section 9b.

> 2026-06-13 guard-environment hardening: regression-guard, guard-self-test,
> drift-guard, and post-incident-watch now work correctly on Windows Git Bash
> (real-Python interpreter probing instead of the `python3` Store stub, pinned
> `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8` for `grep -P`, LF-normalized `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5`
> with a `*.md5` rule in `.gitattributes`). `scripts/build_code_index.js` no
> longer flags template-literal routes like `${card.page}` as missing mobile
> pages. Full guard suite re-verified green; Worker `/health` live-confirmed
> `1.0.5-sprint189`. Details in `COWORK_SYSTEM_HANDOFF.md` section 9a.

### Current Production State
- **Current phase:** Sprint / Phase 221 (PO acceptance complete; signed LINE raw forwarding release).
- **Latest verified runtime source:** Sprint 221 GAS source deployed to @636; run `git log -1 --oneline` after repository publication for the release commit.
- **PWA release target:** `v5.18.47-sprint221` (build token `20260721_1622`).
- **GAS backend:** `v5.18.23-line-signed-raw`, deployed at @636.
- **Current production GAS deployment:** `AKfycbxAEizN9vW_TGX-PHwxzTW8TVDoGxGoXHTO7Za8WMoiVZsxLLW9wR5LwzLE432D18VdjQ @636`.
- **Production GAS URL:** `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxAEizN9vW_TGX-PHwxzTW8TVDoGxGoXHTO7Za8WMoiVZsxLLW9wR5LwzLE432D18VdjQ/exec`.
- **Production Spreadsheet ID:** `19fkLbSbBdz0EjAV8nE9LLwBiHeIN50BTPptt_PJCRGA`.
- **Schema registry:** `docs/database_schema_registry.json`.
- **Current status:** main foundation is recovered, hardened, deployed, and protected-live verified. PC/mobile login, dashboard shell, menus, Jobs, Billing, Reports, Vision, LINE read paths, Admin reads, LINE room notification toggles, LINE bot reply toggles, Vision muted-room suppression, Vision runtime reads, and LINE group image ingress readiness have passed the latest protected suites when a fresh session token is supplied.

### What Is Already Complete
- PWA loads the central API client and uses the unified API/session pattern.
- Auth contract mismatch between protected router checks and session validation was corrected earlier.
- GAS URL drift was consolidated around `pwa/gas_config.js` and the production GAS URL above.
- Public/protected action boundaries were hardened; business read APIs are token-aware.
- Dashboard PC and mobile surfaces were restored after menu/runtime regressions.
- Mobile quick actions, More sheet, last-page restore, nested page recovery, and blank-shell recurrence guards are covered.
- PC Jobs, Billing, Reports, Settings, AI Vision, and LINE Command Center have dedicated operator workflow coverage.
- Root GAS source and `clasp-ready` source are expected to stay aligned.
- Database sheet access was normalized through `getComphoneSheet()` / `findSheetByName()` and canonical aliases.
- Database schema guard passes normal and strict mode with 0 warnings after Sprint 109.
- GAS normalized source was pushed and redeployed to the existing production Web App at `@613`, then Sprint 111 repair execution was deployed at `@614`.
- Protected live checks after `@613` passed for Dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Warranty, AI Vision, LINE Center, and Admin read paths.
- Sprint 111 adds the controlled Data Repair Console backend: `previewDataRepair`, `getDataRepairStatus`, and `executeDataRepair`. Execution is blocked unless the owner reviews the candidate, supplies `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR`, and the backend archives to `DB_DATA_REPAIR_ARCHIVE` plus logs to `DB_DATA_REPAIR_AUDIT` before deleting a narrowly scoped orphan Billing row.
- Sprint 112 surfaces the repair layer in the UI: Mobile Admin gets a `Repair` tab via `renderDataRepairConsole_`, and PC Settings gets `settings-data-repair-content` hydrated by `hydrateSettingsDataRepairPanel`.
- Sprint 113-117 adds live Repair Console QA, Jobs workflow continuity guards, Billing incomplete-row resilience, Reports drilldown diagnostics, and preview-first Vision + LINE operational loop guards.
- Sprint 118 identified why GitHub Pages was still serving build `20260516_0845`: Auto Deploy failed in Validate Code because `guard-self-test.sh` checksum integrity still expected the old `regression-guard.sh` hash. `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5` is now updated after adding Sprint 113-117 regression checks.
- Sprint 119 hardens the Inventory/PO/Warranty support chain. PO no longer falls back to AI_EXECUTOR when the central API client is unavailable, and Warranty detail now uses the loaded warranty cache first so it does not send `warranty_id` to the `getWarrantyByJobId` backend contract.
- Sprint 120 hardens Settings/Admin runtime maintenance. PC Settings no longer seeds fake healthy/user data; it hydrates live `health`, `listUsers`, Runtime Self-Test, Data Repair, and diagnostics panels after render.
- Sprint 121 adds PC/mobile performance and accessibility guardrails: mobile page loading watchdog, `aria-busy` state, no-blank diagnostics, focus-visible rings, touch-action optimization, and reduced-motion CSS.
- Sprint 122 adds an operator analytics layer on top of the restored dashboards: PC gets an `operator-insight-strip` for service pressure, cash, risk queue, and AI/LINE loop; Mobile gets a role-safe `operator-pulse-card` on every home role using existing dashboard data only.
- Sprint 123 hardens live visual QA contracts. Mobile local scripts/styles loaded by `index.html` now have complete `pwa_asset_manifest.js` script/precache coverage, and the new guard locks critical page mounts, More-menu routes, quick action modals, dashboard command tiles, and blank-page diagnostics.
- Sprint 124 adds a token-aware protected visual/menu QA runner. It checks Pages freshness, PC/Mobile visual route contracts, Operator Insight/Pulse contracts, quick-action real modal flows, and protected read APIs for Dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Billing, Reports, Inventory, PO, Warranty, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is present.
- Sprint 125 adds role-based PC/Mobile dashboard focus widgets for tech/admin/accounting/executive operators, keeps existing Operator Insight/Pulse surfaces intact, and wires a dedicated audit into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions.
- Sprint 126 formalizes the AI Vision operating boundary: read-runtime is ready with a valid session token, real image analysis remains confirmation-gated, Gemini secret values stay outside the repo, and role-dashboard readiness is guarded together with Vision readiness.
- Sprint 127 adds per-room LINE notification controls. Muting a LINE room suppresses only outbound pushes; AI Vision analysis, backend queues, suppressed-notification audit records, and internal logs continue normally.
- Sprint 188 adds per-room LINE bot reply controls. `LINE_BOT_REPLY_<ROOM>_ENABLED` is separate from `LINE_NOTIFY_<ROOM>_ENABLED`: notification toggles suppress outbound LINE pushes only, while Bot reply toggles suppress webhook replies only. Backend processing, AI Vision logs, photo queues, and audit records continue even when bot replies are off. The LINE Center UI now shows Notify and Bot On/Off controls per room for PC and mobile, including configured rooms plus `PRIVATE` and `UNKNOWN` reply scopes.
- Sprint 188 follow-up adds explicit LINE Center save feedback for both notification toggles and Bot On/Off toggles: the UI now shows saving, success, and failure states so operators can see immediately when bot replies are off while backend processing continues.
- Sprint 189 adds LINE room noise suppression after real-room feedback showed repeated replies for images and AI failure messages. Cloudflare Worker `1.0.5-sprint189` uses `quiet-group-forward`: group/room images and non-command text are still forwarded to GAS for backend processing, AI Vision queues, and audit logs, but their `replyToken` is stripped so LINE does not receive a reply. Explicit commands such as `/groupid`, `เช็คงาน`, `เช็คบิล`, `สรุป`, and intentional AI prompts keep reply capability. GAS now also defaults image acknowledgements to quiet mode with throttled/digest hints as a backend safety net.
- Added `.github/workflows/deploy-line-worker.yml` so changes under `workers/line-webhook/**` deploy the Cloudflare Worker automatically when `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is configured in GitHub Secrets. Local `wrangler whoami` is still unauthenticated on this workstation.
- 2026-05-28 live deploy note: `wrangler login` and `wrangler deploy` were completed from `workers/line-webhook`. The obsolete `line-events` queue bindings were removed from `wrangler.toml` because Worker `1.0.5-sprint189` direct-forwards with `ctx.waitUntil()` and does not use `LINE_QUEUE`. `GAS_URL` is now an explicit non-secret Worker var in `wrangler.toml`; `/health` reports `1.0.5-sprint189`, `/diag/gas` returns healthy, and a synthetic group image webhook returns `reply_policy.stripped=1`.
- Sprint 190 adds the AI Vision Review Inbox to `pwa/section_vision.js` for both PC and mobile. Operators can now see LINE/PWA image ingress as actionable review cards with status filters (`Need JobID`, `Review`, `Failed`, `Linked`, `Approved`), source/room context, confidence, timestamps, safe approve/reject actions, timeline linking, and `getVisionLineIngressStatus` visibility. The guard `scripts/sprint190_ai_vision_review_inbox_guard.js` is wired into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions so this operator-facing Vision inbox cannot silently regress.
- Sprint 191 adds `scripts/sprint191_ai_vision_inbox_render_smoke.js`, a browser-like VM render smoke that executes `section_vision.js` without auth and verifies both PC and mobile Vision surfaces render the Review Inbox, status filters, queue badges, LINE ingress summary, and filter behavior using representative Vision queue records. This catches syntax/render regressions before a protected live token is available.
- Sprint 192 Mobile Dashboard Simplification starts the mobile simplification track. `pwa/app.js` now limits dashboard quick actions to 4, hydrates a local dashboard cache before the live `getDashboardData` call, stores the latest successful dashboard payload for fast boot, and renders the More menu with progressive disclosure so secondary tools stay available without overwhelming operators. `pwa/app_home.js` now uses a compact Mobile Command Center while preserving Operator Pulse, Role Focus, and Decision Layer contracts. `scripts/sprint192_mobile_dashboard_simplification_guard.js` locks these changes into regression guard and CI.
- Sprint 193 adds Delete/Camera/Dashboard hardening after operator feedback. Mobile bottom navigation and FAB no longer open the camera directly; the camera stays inside job detail via `openCameraForJob`. Admin/owner users now get a visible `cleanup-tools` More-menu shortcut to the protected Smoke/Test Data Cleanup panel, and mobile job delete uses `mobileJobApi()` with `callAPI`/`callApi` fallback while keeping backend archive-before-delete gates intact. Guard: `scripts/sprint193_delete_camera_dashboard_guard.js`.
- Sprint 194 adds Job Archive Restore: a preview-and-restore flow for `DBJOBS_ARCHIVE`. New GAS functions `listJobArchive`, `previewJobRestore`, and `restoreJob` are registered in RouterSplit and the API contract. `restoreJob` requires admin/owner role, `RESTORE_JOB` confirmation, and blocks if the JobID already exists in live DBJOBS to prevent silent overwrites; every restore is audit-logged. The admin panel gains an "Archive" tab (mobile + PC) showing archived jobs with preview cards and a confirmation-gated restore button. `DBJOBS_ARCHIVE` is now registered in `docs/database_schema_registry.json`. Guard: `scripts/sprint194_job_archive_restore_guard.js` (23/23).
- Database direction after Sprint 192: keep Google Sheets as the owner-readable ledger/audit source for now; add Cloudflare D1 later as an operational read/cache layer for mobile dashboard and reports once the lightweight mobile API/write reliability work is stable.
- Sprint 128 adds token-aware live QA for LINE notification toggles. Default mode is read-only/skip-safe; real toggle validation requires `COMPHONE_LINE_TOGGLE_CONFIRM=RUN_NOTIFICATION_TOGGLE_ROLLBACK` and rolls the room setting back immediately.
- Sprint 129 adds token-aware AI Vision LINE suppression QA. Default mode is skip-safe; real proof requires `COMPHONE_VISION_LINE_SUPPRESSION_CONFIRM=RUN_MUTED_VISION_NOTIFICATION`, mutes one configured room, executes a muted Vision notification suggestion, verifies `skipped=true`, then rolls the room setting back.
- Sprint 130 deploys GAS @616 on the existing production Web App URL, opens the Router dynamic whitelist for Vision/LINE protected actions, hardens LINE room payload normalization, and verifies the full protected Vision + LINE live suite with a fresh login token kept only in process memory.
- Sprint 131 adds `scripts/sprint131_line_real_send_readiness.js`, a token-aware readiness guard that proves LINE preview, confirmation-required blocking, muted-send suppression, and rollback without sending outbound LINE messages. Real sends require owner approval through `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND=1`, `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND_CONFIRM=OWNER_APPROVED_REAL_LINE_SEND`, and `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND_MESSAGE`.
- Sprint 132 adds `scripts/sprint132_core_workflow_live_qa.js`, a token-aware read-only workflow proof for Jobs -> Billing -> Reports -> AI Vision -> LINE Center. Protected live run passed; `getBilling` stayed optional because latest Job `J0020` has no Billing row.
- Sprint 133 adds `scripts/sprint133_support_admin_live_qa.js`, a token-aware read-only workflow proof for Inventory -> PO -> Warranty -> Admin Settings. Protected live run passed for inventory overview/detail, PO list, warranty list/due, security status, users list, data repair status, and data repair preview; warranty detail stayed optional because the live list returned no `Job_ID`.
- Sprint 134 adds `scripts/sprint134_data_completeness_review.js`, a read-only and token-aware data completeness review. Protected live run reports four business-data findings without failing CI: incomplete Billing source row, latest Job `J0020` missing Billing detail, empty current-month daily revenue rows, and empty Warranty list.
- Sprint 135 adds owner-facing Data Completeness panels to PC Settings and Mobile Admin. Both panels use read-only APIs (`checkJobs`, `listBillings`, `getBilling`, `getReportData`, `listWarranties`, `previewDataRepair`) and keep destructive repair behind the existing `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR` flow.
- Sprint 136 adds owner review workflow controls to those panels: export review summary JSON, localStorage-backed review notes, mark-reviewed status, and deep links to Billing/Reports/Warranty. These controls never call `executeDataRepair`.
- Sprint 137 adds backend review log actions `getDataReviewLog` and `saveDataReviewLog`, registers `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG`, and updates PC/Mobile panels to sync review notes/status through the backend with localStorage fallback.
- Sprint 138 adds `scripts/sprint138_backend_review_log_live_qa.js`, a token-aware protected live QA for `getDataReviewLog` and `saveDataReviewLog`. It writes only a QA review metadata row (`sprint138-live-qa-review-log`) and confirms `previewDataRepair` remains preview-only. If the deploying account can read the spreadsheet but cannot create/write the new review sheet, the backend stores review metadata in Apps Script Properties under a `script_properties_fallback` path until spreadsheet edit permissions are corrected.
- Sprint 139 adds `scripts/sprint139_data_cleanup_triage.js` to classify data gaps as manual backfill, controlled repair candidates, or acceptable empty states without production mutation.
- Sprint 140 adds `scripts/sprint140_jobs_billing_reports_live_polish.js` to guard the Jobs -> Billing -> Reports chain and keep missing data diagnosable instead of blank.
- Sprint 141 adds `scripts/sprint141_mobile_menu_deep_qa.js` to lock mobile route/page contracts, last-page restore, quick actions, and protected menu API readiness.
- Sprint 142 adds `scripts/sprint142_ai_vision_real_use_readiness.js` to guard AI Vision real-use boundaries: preview-first suggestions, confirmation-gated analysis, and no real LINE send without owner approval.
- Sprint 143 adds `scripts/sprint143_permission_ops_hardening.js` to verify review-log permission fallback, production URL stability, and no secret leakage in committed files.
- Sprint 144 adds `scripts/sprint144_owner_data_resolution.js` to turn Sprint 139 findings into an owner-approved non-mutating resolution plan.
- Sprint 145 adds `scripts/sprint145_mobile_ux_walkthrough.js` to guard mobile grouped menus, dashboard quick-action settings, current-page recovery, and protected read paths.
- Sprint 146 adds `scripts/sprint146_ai_vision_pilot_workflow.js` to prove the AI Vision pilot loop can read Vision/LINE state and preview room messages without real sends.
- Sprint 147 adds the PC `dashboard-decision-layer` in `pwa/dashboard.js` plus `scripts/sprint147_dashboard_decision_layer_audit.js` so Jobs/Billing/Reports/Inventory/Vision/LINE next actions remain visible and read-only.
- Sprint 148 adds `scripts/sprint148_ops_permission_cleanup.js` to guard `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` registry coverage, fallback visibility, production URL stability, and committed-secret hygiene before retiring fallback storage.
- Sprint 149 adds `scripts/sprint149_live_browser_visual_qa.js` for live GitHub Pages PC/Mobile visual readiness, build freshness, and protected read probes.
- Sprint 150 adds `scripts/sprint150_data_cleanup_owner_workflow.js` for owner-approved cleanup workflow around `jobs:J0022`, `jobs:J0021`, `customers:C0003`, and `customers:C0002` without mutation.
- Sprint 151 adds a Mobile Dashboard Decision Layer in `pwa/app_home.js` with CSS in `pwa/mobile_glass.css`, aligned with the PC dashboard decision layer.
- Sprint 152 adds `scripts/sprint152_ai_vision_real_pilot_guard.js` for AI Vision real-pilot readiness. Real image analysis requires explicit env gates; real LINE send is not performed by the guard.
- Sprint 153 adds `scripts/sprint153_permission_fallback_closure.js` to keep review-log fallback visible until live storage proves `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` sheet writes are stable.
- Sprint 154 adds `scripts/sprint154_post_deploy_pages_confirmation.js` to track GitHub Pages freshness after deploy and report `cdn_pending` without masking HTTP failures.

- Sprint 162 adds `scripts/sprint162_owner_data_cleanup_decision.js`, a decision-only owner cleanup matrix for `J0022`, `J0021`, `C0003`, and `C0002`. It never invokes repair/delete/create actions.
- Sprint 163 adds `scripts/sprint163_ai_vision_real_sample_pilot.js`, a gated real-sample Vision pilot. Real analysis requires a token, explicit confirmation env vars, and sample image input; the script never sends LINE messages.
- Sprint 164 adds `scripts/sprint164_pages_publish_lock.js` to wrap post-publish checks and optionally fail stale Pages assets when `COMPHONE_PAGES_REQUIRE_FRESH=1`.
- Sprint 165 adds `scripts/sprint165_browser_profile_clickthrough_pack.js` to generate the real browser/profile walkthrough checklist and reuse the Sprint 160 route contract.
- Sprint 166 adds `scripts/sprint166_protected_token_full_sweep_pack.js` to run Sprint 161 plus `pwa_api_smoke.js` in one read-only protected sweep pack.
- Sprint 167 adds `scripts/sprint167_owner_cleanup_execution_readiness.js` to prove cleanup execution gates, archive-before-change, and decision-only mode remain intact.
- Sprint 168 adds `scripts/sprint168_ai_vision_real_sample_runbook.js` to document and verify the exact env gates required for a real Vision sample pilot without LINE sends.
- Sprint 169 adds `scripts/sprint169_pages_fresh_release_gate.js` as a strict post-publish release gate that fails stale GitHub Pages assets.
- Sprint 170 adds `scripts/sprint170_protected_browser_acceptance_gate.js` to combine browser route acceptance with protected read proof when a fresh token is supplied.
- Sprint 171 adds `scripts/sprint171_ai_vision_sample_evidence_contract.js` to lock Vision evidence shape: Vision log id, review queue, human review, field context, and job timeline link.
- Sprint 172 adds `scripts/sprint172_line_room_notification_matrix_gate.js` to guard per-room LINE notification toggles without stopping backend Vision/log/audit work.
- Sprint 173 adds `scripts/sprint173_release_readiness_master_gate.js` to aggregate Pages, browser, Vision, LINE, and static guards before release.
- Sprint 174 adds `scripts/sprint174_strict_protected_browser_runbook.js` to make protected PC/mobile browser acceptance strict when `COMPHONE_REQUIRE_PROTECTED_BROWSER_ACCEPTANCE=1` or `COMPHONE_SPRINT174_STRICT_PROTECTED_BROWSER=1`.
- Sprint 175 adds `scripts/sprint175_ai_vision_sample_pilot_gate.js` to run real AI Vision sample analysis only when token, sample input, standard Vision confirmation, and owner confirmation are all present; it never sends LINE messages.
- Sprint 176 adds `scripts/sprint176_published_protected_acceptance.js` to verify the published GitHub Pages build and optionally require a live protected token sweep with `COMPHONE_SPRINT176_REQUIRE_LIVE=1`.
- Sprint 177 adds `scripts/sprint177_ai_vision_real_sample_evidence.js` to capture owner-gated AI Vision real-sample evidence. It executes real analysis only when `COMPHONE_SPRINT177_EXECUTE_REAL_SAMPLE=1` and all Sprint 175 gates are also set.
- Sprint 178 adds `scripts/sprint178_strict_live_acceptance_gate.js` as the final strict protected-live acceptance wrapper. Real strict proof requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `COMPHONE_SPRINT178_STRICT_LIVE=1`.
- Sprint 179 adds `scripts/sprint179_ai_vision_real_sample_execution.js` as the final owner-gated real AI Vision sample execution wrapper. Real execution requires all Sprint 175/177 gates plus `COMPHONE_SPRINT179_EXECUTE_REAL_SAMPLE=1`.
- Sprint 180 adds `scripts/sprint180_strict_protected_live_proof.js` as the operator-facing strict protected-live proof wrapper. Real strict proof requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `COMPHONE_SPRINT180_RUN_STRICT_PROOF=1`.
- Sprint 181 adds `scripts/sprint181_ai_vision_owner_sample_run.js` as the operator-facing owner-approved AI Vision sample run wrapper. Real execution requires all Sprint 179 gates plus `COMPHONE_SPRINT181_OWNER_RUN=1`.
- Sprint 182 adds `scripts/sprint182_smoke_cleanup_execution.js` plus PC Settings/Mobile Admin smoke cleanup controls. Cleanup defaults to preview; real archive/delete requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COMPHONE_SPRINT182_EXECUTE_CLEANUP=1`, and `COMPHONE_SPRINT182_CLEANUP_CONFIRM=DELETE_REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`. The backend deletes only rows with smoke/test markers and archives to `DB_SMOKE_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE`.
- Sprint 183 adds `scripts/sprint183_line_ai_vision_ingress_guard.js` and `getVisionLineIngressStatus` to prove the LINE image path: LINE webhook signature -> `queuePhotoFromLINE` -> Drive/PHOTO_QUEUE -> queued Gemini processing -> Sheet/Drive evidence. The guard never sends LINE messages.
- Sprint 185 adds `scripts/sprint185_line_group_image_pilot.js`, a no-send LINE group image pilot guard. On 2026-05-25 it passed public + protected live readiness with a temporary login token kept only in process memory: `ready=true`, `gemini_secret=true`, `line_channel_token=true`, `notification_toggles=true`, `pending_photos=0`, and `total_photos=1`. The remaining owner action is to send one real JobID-tagged image in the configured LINE group and rerun the guard to confirm Sheet/Drive/Vision evidence growth.
- Sprint 185 incident follow-up on 2026-05-25: a real image sent to the Sales LINE room did not enter `DB_PHOTO_QUEUE`. Root cause was the production Cloudflare Worker `GAS_URL` binding pointing to an older GAS endpoint, so LINE events were forwarded away from the active backend. The Worker was redeployed as `1.0.1-sprint185` with `GAS_URL` bound to the active production GAS URL and raw `X-Line-Signature` forwarding preserved. The local Worker source was reconciled. GAS source now also supports short-lived JobID context memory for image messages, but clasp deploy is pending because the local clasp credential returned `invalid_grant`.
- Sprint 185 LINE reply follow-up on 2026-05-25: `/groupid` still did not reply after the Worker URL fix because GAS Web Apps do not reliably expose custom headers to `doPost`, while `verifyLineSignature_` expects `e.parameter['X-Line-Signature']` as fallback. The Worker was redeployed as `1.0.2-sprint185` and now forwards the LINE signature both as an HTTP header and as the `X-Line-Signature` query parameter to the active GAS URL.
- Sprint 185 Worker diagnostic follow-up on 2026-05-25: production Worker was redeployed as `1.0.3-sprint185` with `/diag/gas`. Live diagnostic returned Worker 200 -> GAS 200, `gas_health_status=healthy`, `gemini_ok=true`, and `line_ok=true`. If `/groupid` still does not reply after this, check LINE Developers webhook delivery/verify status and bot membership in the target room.
- Sprint 185 AI Agent follow-up on 2026-05-25: Sales-room messages reached `processWithAILineAgent` but Gemini returned no usable text, producing the generic "AI Agent processing failed" reply. Source now routes LINE commands/photos/status updates before AI Agent interception, upgrades AI text calls from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-2.0-flash`, accepts all configured Gemini key aliases, and returns a dashboard-backed fallback reply instead of a dead-end error. GAS deploy is required before this behavior is live.
- Sprint 185 Sales room live proof on 2026-05-25: `/groupid` in the Sales LINE room replied successfully with `Cb7cc146227212f70e4f171ef3f2bce15`, matching `LINE_GROUP_SALES` and the `SALES_ANALYST` role mapping. This proves LINE platform -> Worker -> active GAS -> LINE reply path is live for the Sales room.
- Sprint 185 Sales room config hardening on 2026-05-25: `LINE_GROUP_SALES` is now also present as a code fallback in `Config.gs`/`clasp-ready/Config.gs`, and billing Flex notifications resolve room IDs through the shared LINE room resolver before falling back to Script Properties. This prevents modules that read `LINE_GROUP_SALES` directly from treating the verified Sales room as unconfigured.
- Sprint 186 Technician room AI routing hardening on 2026-05-25: Technician/Dispatcher rooms no longer send every work-related message through Gemini. Deterministic commands, status updates, photo reports, and work notes run first; AI Agent is invoked only when the operator explicitly asks for AI/analysis. This prevents generic AI failure replies from blocking normal technician-room workflows.
- Sprint 186 private LINE chat hardening on 2026-05-25: private one-to-one bot greetings such as `สวัสดี` are handled by deterministic help text and never routed into Gemini/AI Agent. AI in private chat is invoked only by explicit AI intent keywords.
- Sprint 186 Worker private-greeting safety on 2026-05-25: Worker `1.0.4-sprint186` intercepts one-to-one LINE greetings (`สวัสดี`, `hello`, `hi`, `หวัดดี`) before forwarding to GAS. If a Worker LINE token binding exists it replies with COMPHONE help text; otherwise it still suppresses forwarding so stale GAS AI code cannot return the generic AI failure for private greetings.
- Sprint 186 Accounting LINE image hardening on 2026-05-25: images sent in the Accounting LINE room without a prior JobID are now accepted into the photo queue as `ACCOUNTING_PENDING` instead of being rejected. This matches LINE behavior where image messages do not reliably carry caption text; operators can still type a JobID before a photo when they want immediate job/billing linkage.
- Sprint 187 Room-aware LINE AI/Vision hardening on 2026-05-25: LINE replies and image intake now use a room policy layer before AI. Technician keeps strict JobID for work photos; Accounting accepts slip/evidence images as `ACCOUNTING_PENDING`; Sales, Procurement, and Executive receive their own pending contexts. AI roles are split into `DISPATCHER`, `ACCOUNTING_ANALYST`, `SALES_ANALYST`, `PROCUREMENT_ASSISTANT`, `BI`, and `PRIVATE_ASSISTANT` with an explicit no-guessing rule. Guard: `scripts/sprint187_line_room_intelligence_guard.js`.

### Known Remaining Work
- **Data repair 1:** `DB_BILLING` still has 1/1 incomplete source row. Sprint 134 confirms this is a business-data gap, not a routing failure.
- **Data repair 2:** latest Job `J0020` still has no readable Billing detail. Confirm whether this job should have Billing before creating or repairing data.
- **Data repair 3:** current-month report daily revenue records are empty. Sprint 116 shows `report-empty-state`; Sprint 134 confirms the backend is healthy but the selected period has no daily revenue rows.
- **Data repair 4:** Warranty list is live and healthy but currently empty. No detail-link repair is possible until source warranty rows exist.
- **Next recommended sprint:** Sprint 186 should add a restore flow for `DBJOBS_ARCHIVE` so archived jobs can be recovered by owner/admin when needed. In parallel, the owner should complete the Sprint 185 real LINE group image pilot by sending one JobID-tagged image in the configured room, then rerun `node scripts/sprint185_line_group_image_pilot.js` with a fresh token/login env to verify Sheet/Drive/Vision evidence growth. Do not run real LINE sends, destructive job deletes, or `executeDataRepair` from CI.
- **LINE image retry note:** after the Worker fix, retry in the real Sales LINE room by sending a text message with a current JobID first, for example `J0020 รูปทดสอบ AI Vision`, then send one image. Until the GAS JobID-context patch is deployed, an image sent without a detectable JobID may still reply asking for JobID instead of entering the queue.
- **After Sprint 133:** run a human-approved LINE real-send test only if the owner explicitly chooses a target room and message; otherwise keep LINE validation in preview/muted-send mode.

### Non-Negotiable Rules For Future Agents
- Do not change the production GAS URL unless intentionally migrating deployment. If changed, update `pwa/gas_config.js`, this BLUEPRINT, deploy verification expectations, and GitHub Pages verification together.
- Do not create or reference new `DB_*` sheets without updating `docs/database_schema_registry.json` and passing the schema guard.
- Do not use `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` in production business modules when `getComphoneSheet()` or `findSheetByName()` can be used.
- Do not write, delete, or repair real Sheet data without explicit preview, archive-before-change, owner confirmation, and audit logging.
- Do not print or commit real secrets, session tokens, LINE tokens, Gemini keys, clasp credentials, or GitHub tokens. Real secrets belong in Apps Script Properties or GitHub Secrets only.
- Keep root GAS files and `clasp-ready` files aligned. Run `node scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` before deployment.
- Preserve Thai UTF-8 labels and verify mobile/PC menus after UI changes.
- If a menu looks blank, check script load order, route mount target, auth/session state, More-sheet fallback, and service worker cache version before rewriting features.

### Phase 185 LINE Group Image Pilot Readiness (2026-05-25)
- Added `scripts/sprint185_line_group_image_pilot.js` to verify the production LINE group image -> AI Vision queue path without sending LINE messages or injecting fake production images.
- Skip-safe run passed 12/12 with public health and code/contract checks.
- Protected live run passed 13/13 using a temporary login token kept only in process memory. Live status returned `ready=true`, `gemini_secret=true`, `line_channel_token=true`, `line_signature_guard=true`, `line_image_queue=true`, `photo_queue_sheet=true`, `queued_processing=true`, `notification_toggles=true`, `pending_photos=0`, and `total_photos=1`.
- This proves the backend is ready to receive LINE group images. The only unproven step is the human/operator action of sending one real JobID-tagged image in the configured LINE group, then rerunning the guard to confirm Sheet/Drive/Vision evidence increased.
- Real Sales-room test initially produced no queue growth. Cloudflare Worker production was found pointing at an old GAS deployment through its `GAS_URL` binding. The Worker was corrected and redeployed through the Cloudflare API as `1.0.1-sprint185`; `/health` now reports the active GAS URL prefix. The repo Worker source matches the deployed direct-forwarder.
- `/groupid` no-reply follow-up: production Worker was upgraded again to `1.0.2-sprint185` so Apps Script receives `X-Line-Signature` via query parameter as well as header. Re-test `/groupid` before image testing.
- Worker diagnostic `/diag/gas` was added and live-tested: Worker reaches the active GAS URL and reports healthy AI/LINE config. This separates Worker/GAS reachability from LINE platform delivery or room membership issues.
- AI Agent source now keeps `/groupid`, `เช็คงาน`, `สรุป`, status updates, and image handling on deterministic command paths before optional Gemini analysis. If Gemini fails, the user receives a practical dashboard fallback instead of a generic failure message.
- Sales room `/groupid` live proof passed with group ID `Cb7cc146227212f70e4f171ef3f2bce15`. Next live proof is one JobID-tagged image in the same room, then rerun Sprint 185 to confirm `DB_PHOTO_QUEUE`/Drive evidence growth.
- Sales room config is hardened in both root GAS source and `clasp-ready`: `LINE_GROUP_SALES` fallback is `Cb7cc146227212f70e4f171ef3f2bce15`, and Flex billing-to-sales notifications use the shared LINE room resolver.
- Technician room AI routing is hardened: normal work messages no longer enter AI automatically, and AI fallback text is readable Thai. If a technician still sees the old generic AI failure reply, the live GAS deployment is still running stale source and must be redeployed from `clasp-ready`.
- Private LINE chat is hardened: `สวัสดี` now returns a COMPHONE Bot help reply without touching AI. If the old AI error still appears in private chat, the live Apps Script deployment is stale.
- Worker private-greeting guard is available as an edge safety net while Apps Script deploy credentials are being refreshed.
- Accounting LINE room images no longer require an immediate JobID. No-JobID accounting images are queued under `ACCOUNTING_PENDING` for later owner/admin review and linking.
- Room-aware LINE AI/Vision is now guarded: responses must match the current room, ask for missing JobID/bill/customer context when needed, and must not invent numbers or status.
- Added GAS-side JobID context helpers in `LineBot.gs` / `clasp-ready/LineBot.gs` so operators can send `J0020` then a photo. This source change is not live until clasp/GAS API credentials are refreshed and the Apps Script project is pushed/deployed.
- No real LINE send, destructive data repair, smoke cleanup delete, or job delete was executed by this sprint.

### Phase 153 Live Visual + AI Vision Pilot + Permission Closure Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 149: added live GitHub Pages visual readiness guard for PC/Mobile HTML, build freshness, central API client, decision-layer presence, More-menu safety, and optional protected route read probes.
- Sprint 150: added owner data cleanup workflow for `jobs:J0022`, `jobs:J0021`, `customers:C0003`, and `customers:C0002`. This is plan/inspect only and never invokes `executeDataRepair`.
- Sprint 151: added Mobile Dashboard Decision Layer. The mobile home now ranks next actions across Service, Billing, Reports, Stock, Vision, and LINE and links the settings button to quick-action editing.
- Sprint 152: added AI Vision real-pilot guard. Default mode verifies readiness and preview paths only; real image analysis requires `COMPHONE_AI_VISION_REAL_PILOT=1` and `COMPHONE_AI_VISION_REAL_PILOT_CONFIRM=RUN_AI_VISION_PILOT`. The guard never sends real LINE messages.
- Sprint 153: added permission fallback closure guard. Fallback remains active until protected live storage proves `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` sheet storage is stable.
- Wired Sprint 149-153 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Local skip-safe run on 2026-05-21 passed Sprint 149 9/9, Sprint 150 7/7, Sprint 151 7/7, Sprint 152 7/7, and Sprint 153 6/6.
- Protected live sweep on 2026-05-21 used a fresh hidden admin token kept only in process memory. Sprint 149 passed 15/15, Sprint 150 passed 10/10, Sprint 152 passed 12/12, and Sprint 153 passed 7/7. Sprint 151 is static UI/contract guard and passed 7/7. No real data repair, real Vision write, or real LINE send was executed.

### Phase 158 Post-Deploy + Mobile/PC Workflow + AI Vision LINE Control Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 154: added post-deploy GitHub Pages confirmation. It verifies mobile/PC HTTP, `version_config.js`, `gas_config.js`, `sw.js`, central API client loading, GAS URL freshness, and records `cdn_pending` while Pages has not yet published the new commit.
- Sprint 155: added owner data backfill readiness for `J0022`, `J0021`, `C0003`, and `C0002`. It keeps repair/backfill review-only unless the owner explicitly approves a separate archive-before-change mutation sprint.
- Sprint 156: added Mobile Menu E2E guard covering central API client, grouped More sheet, current-page restore, back-button safety, blank-page diagnostics, decision layer, quick-action settings, and optional protected read probes.
- Sprint 157: added PC Dashboard Workflow guard for load order, last-section restore, missing-section diagnostics, Jobs open flow, Billing payment flow, Reports module, AI Vision panel, LINE Center panel, and Settings quick-action link.
- Sprint 158: added AI Vision + LINE room-control guard. It verifies room mute semantics, Vision muted-room suppression, preview-before-execute, real-send gates, router exposure, and optional protected live reads without sending LINE messages.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.36-sprint158` / `20260521_0100`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Local skip-safe run on 2026-05-21 passed Sprint 154 with HTTP OK and expected `cdn_pending`, Sprint 155 6/6, Sprint 156 11/11, Sprint 157 11/11, and Sprint 158 9/9. No real data repair, real Vision write, or real LINE send was executed.
- Wired Sprint 154-158 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 163 Publish + Browser Contract + Protected Sweep + Vision Sample Pilot Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 159: added strict-but-safe Pages publish confirmation. Default mode records `cdn_pending`; set `COMPHONE_PAGES_REQUIRE_FRESH=1` for a blocking post-publish run.
- Sprint 160: added real browser click-through contract for PC/Mobile routes, renderers, diagnostics, last-page/last-section restore, and optional protected read probes.
- Sprint 161: added protected live token sweep for public health/version plus protected Dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Billing, Reports, Inventory, PO, Vision, LINE, and Admin reads.
- Sprint 162: added owner data cleanup decision pack for `J0022`, `J0021`, `C0003`, and `C0002`. This is decision-only and never calls destructive repair/create/delete actions.
- Sprint 163: added AI Vision real sample pilot. Default mode checks readiness and skips real analysis; real sample analysis requires explicit env gates and sample image input. The script never sends LINE messages.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.37-sprint163` / `20260521_0200` for this phase; PC and Mobile asset query strings pointed at the same build.
- Local skip-safe run on 2026-05-21 passed Sprint 159 with HTTP OK and expected `cdn_pending`, Sprint 160 47/47, Sprint 161 16/16 skip-safe, Sprint 162 6/6, and Sprint 163 6/6. No real data repair, real Vision write, or real LINE send was executed.
- Wired Sprint 159-163 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 168 Pages Publish + Browser/Profile + Protected Token + AI Vision Runbook Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 164: added Pages Publish Lock wrapper. Default mode tolerates `cdn_pending`; set `COMPHONE_PAGES_REQUIRE_FRESH=1` only after GitHub Pages should already be serving the new build.
- Sprint 165: added Browser/Profile Click-Through Pack. It reuses the route contract and records a human/browser walkthrough checklist for Mobile and PC.
- Sprint 166: added Protected Token Full Sweep Pack. It runs Sprint 161 and `pwa_api_smoke.js`; protected actions remain skip-safe unless `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set.
- Sprint 167: added Owner Cleanup Execution Readiness. It verifies `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR`, archive-before-change coverage, and no mutation from the guard.
- Sprint 168: added AI Vision Real Sample Runbook. It verifies the gated Sprint 163 pilot path and records the exact env vars needed for real sample analysis; no LINE sends are performed.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.38-sprint168` / `20260521_0300`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Local skip-safe run on 2026-05-21 passed Sprint 164 with expected `cdn_pending`, Sprint 165 3/3, Sprint 166 3/3 skip-safe, Sprint 167 4/4, and Sprint 168 3/3. No real data repair, real Vision write, or real LINE send was executed.
- Wired Sprint 164-168 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 173 Release Readiness + AI/LINE Evidence Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 169: added strict Pages Fresh Release Gate. It wraps Sprint 164 in `COMPHONE_PAGES_REQUIRE_FRESH=1` mode and fails if GitHub Pages still serves an older version/build/cache.
- Sprint 170: added Protected Browser Acceptance Gate. It combines Sprint 165 browser route acceptance and Sprint 166 protected token sweep; strict protected mode is enabled with `COMPHONE_REQUIRE_PROTECTED_BROWSER_ACCEPTANCE=1`.
- Sprint 171: added AI Vision Sample Evidence Contract. It proves the real-sample path records `visionLogId`, supports review queue/human review, field context, and job timeline linking without exposing secrets or sending LINE.
- Sprint 172: added LINE Room Notification Matrix Gate. It verifies per-room notification toggles are notification-only: backend processing, Vision logs, queues, and audit continue even when room pushes are muted.
- Sprint 173: added Release Readiness Master Gate. It aggregates Pages, browser, AI Vision evidence, LINE matrix, and PWA static guard; strict Pages/protected modes require explicit env flags.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.39-sprint173` / `20260521_0400`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Local skip-safe run on 2026-05-21 is intended to pass Sprint 169 only after Pages publishes this commit; Sprint 170-173 remain read-only/skip-safe without a token. No real data repair, real Vision write, or real LINE send is executed by this pack.
- Wired Sprint 169-173 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 175 Strict Protected Browser + AI Vision Sample Gate Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 174: added Strict Protected Browser Runbook. Default mode is CI-safe; strict mode requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` plus `COMPHONE_REQUIRE_PROTECTED_BROWSER_ACCEPTANCE=1` or `COMPHONE_SPRINT174_STRICT_PROTECTED_BROWSER=1` and proves protected browser/API reads actually ran.
- Sprint 175: added AI Vision Sample Pilot Gate. Default mode verifies readiness only; real sample analysis requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, sample image input, `COMPHONE_AI_VISION_SAMPLE_PILOT=1`, `COMPHONE_AI_VISION_SAMPLE_CONFIRM=RUN_REAL_SAMPLE_ANALYSIS`, and `COMPHONE_SPRINT175_OWNER_CONFIRM=RUN_OWNER_APPROVED_AI_SAMPLE`.
- Sprint 175 never sends LINE messages. Do not set `COMPHONE_LINE_SEND_CONFIRM` during this pilot.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.40-sprint175` / `20260521_0500`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Wired Sprint 174-175 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 177 Published Protected Acceptance + AI Vision Real Sample Evidence Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 176: added Published Protected Acceptance. It verifies the live GitHub Pages build first, then runs the strict protected browser runbook; strict live proof requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `COMPHONE_SPRINT176_REQUIRE_LIVE=1`.
- Sprint 177: added AI Vision Real Sample Evidence. Default mode is readiness-only; real analysis requires `COMPHONE_SPRINT177_EXECUTE_REAL_SAMPLE=1` plus all Sprint 175 token/sample/owner gates.
- Sprint 177 never sends LINE messages and blocks if LINE real-send env vars are present.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.41-sprint177` / `20260521_0600`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Wired Sprint 176-177 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 179 Strict Live Acceptance + AI Vision Real Sample Execution Gate Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 178: added Strict Live Acceptance Gate. Default mode is CI-safe; strict mode requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `COMPHONE_SPRINT178_STRICT_LIVE=1`, then delegates to Sprint 176 with live and Pages freshness required.
- Sprint 179: added AI Vision Real Sample Execution Gate. Default mode is readiness-only; real execution requires all Sprint 175 and Sprint 177 owner gates plus `COMPHONE_SPRINT179_EXECUTE_REAL_SAMPLE=1`.
- Sprint 179 never sends LINE messages and blocks if LINE real-send env vars are present.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.42-sprint179` / `20260521_0700`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Wired Sprint 178-179 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 181 Strict Protected Live Proof + AI Vision Owner Sample Run Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 180: added Strict Protected Live Proof. Default mode is CI-safe; strict mode requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` and `COMPHONE_SPRINT180_RUN_STRICT_PROOF=1`.
- Sprint 181: added AI Vision Owner Sample Run. Default mode is readiness-only; real sample execution requires all Sprint 179 gates plus `COMPHONE_SPRINT181_OWNER_RUN=1`.
- Sprint 181 never sends LINE messages and blocks if LINE real-send env vars are present.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.43-sprint181` / `20260521_0800`; PC and Mobile asset query strings now point at the same build.
- Wired Sprint 180-181 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 183 Smoke Cleanup + LINE AI Vision Ingress Pack (2026-05-21)
- Sprint 182: added controlled smoke/test data cleanup execution controls to PC Settings and Mobile Admin. The backend still deletes only rows with smoke markers, archives each deleted row into `DB_SMOKE_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE`, and requires the exact phrase `DELETE_REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`.
- Sprint 182 added `scripts/sprint182_smoke_cleanup_execution.js`. Default mode is preview-only; real execution requires `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COMPHONE_SPRINT182_EXECUTE_CLEANUP=1`, and `COMPHONE_SPRINT182_CLEANUP_CONFIRM=DELETE_REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`.
- Sprint 183 added `getVisionLineIngressStatus` and `scripts/sprint183_line_ai_vision_ingress_guard.js` to verify LINE group image readiness without sending LINE messages.
- Current LINE image behavior: the webhook verifies signature, queues JobID-tagged images through `queuePhotoFromLINE`, stores them in Drive/PHOTO_QUEUE, then AI processing runs through `processImageSorting`/`handleProcessPhotos` to write Sheet/Drive evidence.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.45-sprint183` / `20260521_1030`, and `pwa/gas_config.js` now points to production GAS @619.
- Wired Sprint 182-183 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 184 Jobs Detail + Archive Delete Repair (2026-05-21)
- Added protected backend action `getJobDetail` so PC/mobile detail views can fetch a full Sheet-backed job record when dashboard cache data is missing or partial.
- Added admin/owner-only backend action `deleteJob`. It requires `confirm: DELETE_JOB`, archives the DBJOBS row into `DBJOBS_ARCHIVE`, writes `DELETE_JOB` audit context, then deletes the row from `DBJOBS`.
- PC Jobs now exposes Detail and Delete actions in the jobs table/detail modal. Mobile Jobs now opens details reliably and shows Delete Job for admin/owner users.
- `deleteJob` is intentionally destructive but archive-first. Future Sprint 186 should add a restore-from-archive UI before making bulk deletion workflows.
- PWA cache was bumped to `v5.18.47-sprint196` / `20260521_1200`.

### Phase 148 Ops Permission + Decision Layer Pack (2026-05-20)
- Sprint 144: added owner data resolution planning for the Sprint 139 data findings. It creates `test_reports/sprint144_owner_data_resolution_latest.json` and `.md`, requires owner approval, and never invokes `executeDataRepair`.
- Sprint 145: added Mobile UX Walkthrough guard for grouped More menu, quick-action settings, current-page recovery, blank-page diagnostics, and protected read routes.
- Sprint 146: added AI Vision Pilot Workflow guard for Vision stats, pipeline, suggestions, review queue, LINE room status, and preview messages with no real LINE send.
- Sprint 147: added PC Dashboard Decision Layer in `pwa/dashboard.js`. It ranks next actions across Jobs, Billing, Reports, Inventory, AI Vision, and LINE using live dashboard metrics and opens existing routes only.
- Sprint 148: added Ops Permission Cleanup readiness guard. `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` remains registered, fallback remains visible until spreadsheet write permission is fixed, and secret hygiene is checked.
- Wired Sprint 144-148 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Skip-safe local run on 2026-05-20 passed 100/100 for Sprints 144-148 without real production mutation, real LINE send, or secret/token persistence.
- Protected live sweep on 2026-05-20 used a fresh hidden admin token kept only in process memory. Sprint 144 passed 8/8, Sprint 145 passed 25/25, Sprint 146 passed 11/11, and Sprint 148 passed 9/9. Sprint 147 is static UI/contract guard and passed 8/8. No real data repair and no real LINE send were executed.

### Phase 143 Permission/Ops Hardening Pack (2026-05-20)
- Sprint 139: added read-only data cleanup triage for Billing, latest unbilled Job, current-month Reports, Warranty source rows, and Data Repair preview candidates.
- Sprint 140: added Jobs -> Billing -> Reports live-polish guard to ensure missing records produce diagnostics rather than blank UI.
- Sprint 141: added Mobile Menu Deep QA for route/page contracts, last-page restore, blank-page diagnostics, quick actions, and protected menu action readiness.
- Sprint 142: added AI Vision real-use readiness guard for confirmation-gated analysis, preview-first suggestions, LINE notification suppression, and owner-gated real sends.
- Sprint 143: added permission/ops hardening guard for review-log fallback visibility, stable production URL, and no committed Google/LINE secret leakage.
- All Sprints 139-143 are CI-safe without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`; protected live proof should be run with a fresh hidden token before any owner-approved data mutation.
- Protected live sweep on 2026-05-20 passed: Sprint 139 found 4 triage items, Sprint 140 passed 8/8, Sprint 141 passed 26/26, Sprint 142 passed 9/9, and Sprint 143 passed 7/7. No repair execution and no real LINE send were performed.

### Phase 138 Backend Review Log Live QA (2026-05-19)
- Added `scripts/sprint138_backend_review_log_live_qa.js`.
- Default CI mode is skip-safe when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is absent.
- Protected mode verifies `getDataReviewLog`, writes one QA metadata row via `saveDataReviewLog`, reads it back, and calls `previewDataRepair` only as preview proof.
- The script is wired into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- No production business record is created, repaired, archived, or deleted by this QA. The only intentional write is review metadata under `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` plus audit context under `DB_DATA_REPAIR_AUDIT`; if sheet write permission is unavailable, review metadata/audit context falls back to Apps Script Properties (`DATA_REVIEW_LOG_JSON`, `DATA_REVIEW_LOG_AUDIT_JSON`) and reports `storage: script_properties_fallback`.
- Deployed to the existing production Web App as GAS `@618` and protected live QA passed 100/100 with a hidden token kept only in process memory.

### Phase 137 Backend Review Log (2026-05-19)
- Added backend actions `getDataReviewLog` and `saveDataReviewLog` in root and `clasp-ready` `DataRepairConsole.gs`.
- Added canonical support table `DB_DATA_REVIEW_LOG` to `docs/database_schema_registry.json`.
- Wired review-log actions through `RouterSplit.gs`, dynamic Router whitelist, `pwa/app.js`, and `pwa/api_contract.js`.
- PC Settings and Mobile Admin now sync owner review notes/status with the backend first and keep localStorage fallback for pre-deploy/offline continuity.
- Saving review status writes only review metadata and appends audit context to `DB_DATA_REPAIR_AUDIT`; it never calls `executeDataRepair`, archive, or delete.
- Added `scripts/sprint137_backend_review_log_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions syntax validation.

### Phase 136 Data Review Workflow (2026-05-19)
- Added owner review workflow controls to PC Settings and Mobile Admin Data Completeness panels.
- Operators can export the latest review as JSON, add local review notes, mark a finding reviewed, and jump to Billing/Reports/Warranty source menus.
- Review state is stored locally under `comphone_data_completeness_reviews`; it is intentionally not a repair action and does not mutate Sheets.
- Added `scripts/sprint136_data_review_workflow_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions syntax validation.

### Phase 135 Data Completeness Panel (2026-05-19)
- Added a read-only **Data Completeness** panel in PC Settings (`pwa/section_settings.js`) and Mobile Admin Repair tab (`pwa/admin_panel.js`).
- The panels call only read/preview APIs: `checkJobs`, `listBillings`, `getBilling`, `getReportData`, `listWarranties`, and `previewDataRepair`.
- The panels show "System State OK" separately from business-data findings so operators do not confuse incomplete data with app downtime.
- Existing destructive repair remains gated behind `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR`, owner confirmation, archive-before-change, and audit logging.
- Added `scripts/sprint135_data_completeness_panel_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions syntax validation.

### Phase 134 Data Completeness Review (2026-05-19)
- Added `scripts/sprint134_data_completeness_review.js`, a CI-safe and token-aware data review for production gaps affecting Billing detail, Reports revenue drilldown, Warranty detail linkage, and Data Repair preview.
- Without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the script records a skip-safe report and exits OK.
- With a fresh token kept only in process memory, the protected run passed endpoint checks and produced four non-blocking data findings:
  - `DB_BILLING`: 1/1 Billing source rows are incomplete.
  - Latest Job `J0020`: no readable Billing detail in current production data.
  - Reports: current-month daily revenue rows are empty while `getReportData` is healthy.
  - Warranty: `listWarranties` is healthy but currently returns no rows.
- Wired Sprint 134 into static guard, regression guard, GitHub Actions syntax validation, and `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5`.

### Phase 133 Support/Admin Live QA (2026-05-19)
- Added `scripts/sprint133_support_admin_live_qa.js`, a CI-safe protected live QA for the support/admin chain: Inventory -> PO -> Warranty -> Admin Settings.
- Without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the script records a skip-safe report and exits OK.
- With a fresh token kept only in process memory, the protected run passed: `inventoryOverview`, `getInventoryItemDetail`, `listPurchaseOrders`, `listWarranties`, `getWarrantyDue`, `getSecurityStatus`, `listUsers`, `getDataRepairStatus`, and `previewDataRepair`.
- `getWarrantyByJobId` is intentionally optional in this sprint; the live Warranty list currently returned no `Job_ID`, so the script skipped detail read without creating or mutating production data.
- Wired Sprint 133 into static guard, regression guard, GitHub Actions syntax validation, and `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5`.

### Phase 132 Core Workflow Live QA (2026-05-19)
- Added `scripts/sprint132_core_workflow_live_qa.js`, a CI-safe protected live QA for the main operator chain: Jobs -> Billing -> Reports -> AI Vision -> LINE Center.
- Without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the script records a skip-safe report and exits OK.
- With a fresh token kept only in process memory, the protected run passed: `checkJobs`, `getJobTimeline`, `listBillings`, `getReportData`, `getVisionDashboardStats`, `getVisionActionSuggestions`, `getVisionReviewQueue`, `getLineCommandCenter`, `getLineRoomStatus`, and `previewLineRoomMessage`.
- `getBilling` is intentionally optional in this sprint; latest Job `J0020` did not have a Billing row, so the script recorded the detail read as optional without creating or mutating production data.
- Wired Sprint 132 into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions syntax validation.

### Phase 131 LINE Real-Send Readiness (2026-05-19)
- Added `scripts/sprint131_line_real_send_readiness.js`, a CI-safe and token-aware guard for the final LINE outbound safety boundary.
- Without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the guard writes a skip-safe report and exits OK.
- With a fresh token, the guard verifies LINE room status, notification settings, preview, `CONFIRM_REQUIRED` blocking for send attempts without confirmation, muted-send suppression with `SEND_LINE_ROOM_MESSAGE`, and immediate rollback of the room notification setting.
- Real outbound LINE sends remain disabled unless all owner gates are present: `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND=1`, `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND_CONFIRM=OWNER_APPROVED_REAL_LINE_SEND`, and `COMPHONE_LINE_REAL_SEND_MESSAGE`.
- Wired Sprint 131 into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions syntax validation.

### Phase 130 Protected Vision + LINE Live Verification (2026-05-18)
- Fixed the production Router dynamic whitelist so protected Vision/LINE actions cannot fall through to `Function not in whitelist` when `RouterSplit` fast path is unavailable.
- Hardened `LineCommandCenter.gs` room normalization to accept real arrays, JSON-string arrays from GET smoke tools, and comma-separated room lists.
- Pushed Apps Script source and updated the existing production Web App deployment to **@616**. The production URL remains unchanged.
- Ran a token-in-memory Sprint 130 protected proof with no token printed or committed:
  - `scripts/sprint128_line_notification_toggle_live_qa.js`: `getLineNotificationSettings`, preview, toggle, preview, rollback all OK.
  - `scripts/sprint129_vision_line_suppression_live_qa.js`: settings, `getVisionActionSuggestions`, preview, mute, `executeVisionSuggestion`, rollback all OK.
  - `scripts/vision_runtime_smoke.js`: public health/version and all protected Vision read endpoints OK.
  - `scripts/pwa_line_room_smoke.js`: room status, notification settings, command center, and dry-run preview OK. Real LINE send remained disabled.

### Phase 129 AI Vision LINE Suppression Live QA (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint129_vision_line_suppression_live_qa.js`, a token-aware proof harness for muted AI Vision LINE notifications.
- Default mode is CI-safe: without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the script records a protected skip; with token but without confirmation, it verifies settings, suggestions, and preview only.
- Real suppression proof requires `COMPHONE_VISION_LINE_SUPPRESSION_CONFIRM=RUN_MUTED_VISION_NOTIFICATION`; the script mutes one configured room, executes the `notify_technician` Vision suggestion while muted, verifies the LINE result is `skipped=true`, then restores the original room notification setting.
- Wired Sprint 129 into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions.

### Phase 128 LINE Notification Toggle Live QA (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint128_line_notification_toggle_live_qa.js`, a token-aware live QA runner for room notification settings.
- Default mode is CI-safe: without `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, the script records a protected skip; with token but without confirmation, it verifies settings and preview only.
- Real toggle validation requires `COMPHONE_LINE_TOGGLE_CONFIRM=RUN_NOTIFICATION_TOGGLE_ROLLBACK`; the script flips one room, verifies muted preview state, then restores the original setting immediately.
- Wired Sprint 128 into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions.

### Phase 127 Vision + LINE Notification Controls (2026-05-18)
- Added `getLineNotificationSettings` and `updateLineNotificationSettings` for per-room LINE notification toggles using non-secret keys such as `LINE_NOTIFY_TECHNICIAN_ENABLED`.
- Muting a room is a `notification-only-toggle`: outbound LINE pushes are suppressed for that room, but AI Vision processing, backend write/review queues, suppressed-notification audit logs, and internal alert records continue.
- PC/Mobile LINE Center now shows room notification state and provides Enable/Mute controls per room, with confirmation text explaining that backend processing remains active.
- AI Vision LINE routing now honors the same room toggle before pushing to LINE and records `LINE_NOTIFICATION_SUPPRESSED` when a room is muted.
- Added `scripts/sprint127_vision_line_notification_controls_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and GitHub Actions.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so PC/mobile clients pick up the LINE room notification controls.

### Phase 126 AI Vision + Role Readiness (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint126_ai_vision_role_readiness_audit.js` to make AI Vision status explicit for future agents: read-runtime is ready when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is supplied; real image analysis remains gated by `COMPHONE_VISION_E2E=1` and `COMPHONE_VISION_E2E_CONFIRM=RUN_VISION_ANALYSIS`.
- Guarded the role-dashboard + Vision relationship so Sprint 125 widgets, protected visual QA, Vision UI routes, RouterSplit actions, and Gemini secret key-name contracts cannot drift independently.
- Confirmed secret policy: real Gemini/LINE/session values are not stored in repo; only key names and operating boundaries are documented.
- Wired Sprint 126 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 125 Role-Based Dashboard Widgets (2026-05-18)
- Added PC `role-focus-widget` to the dashboard so tech/admin/accounting/executive users see the most relevant next action from Jobs, Billing, or Reports without losing the existing Operator Insight Strip.
- Added Mobile `mobile-role-focus-card` next to Operator Pulse so field users reopen into a role-aware action surface while preserving quick actions, More-menu routes, and accidental-close restore behavior.
- Kept the sprint frontend-only: no new backend endpoints, no secret changes, and no production data mutation.
- Added `scripts/sprint125_role_based_dashboard_widgets_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so GitHub Pages, service worker, and dashboard assets stay aligned.

### Phase 124 Protected Visual/Menu QA (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint124_protected_visual_menu_qa.js`, a read-only token-aware QA runner for PC dashboard sections and Mobile More-menu pages.
- The runner always checks static visual contracts and GitHub Pages freshness; with `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, it also verifies protected read APIs for Dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Billing, Reports, Inventory, PO, Warranty, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin.
- Guarded mobile accidental-close/last-page restore, quick-action real modal flows, typed More-menu routes, Operator Insight/Pulse surfaces, and blank-page diagnostics in one release-ready script.
- Wired Sprint 124 into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the protected visual/menu QA runbook.

### Phase 123 Live Visual QA Guard (2026-05-18)
- Completed mobile asset manifest coverage so every local script/stylesheet loaded by `pwa/index.html` is also listed in `pwa_asset_manifest.js` and pre-cached by the PWA asset manifest.
- Hardened `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` to fail future releases when mobile index assets drift out of manifest/precache coverage.
- Added `scripts/sprint123_live_visual_qa_guard.js` to lock high-value visual/runtime contracts: page mounts, More-menu routes, quick actions, modal-backed Open Job/Add Customer, dashboard command tiles, and blank-page diagnostics.
- Wired Sprint 123 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the live visual QA guard pass.

### Phase 122 Dashboard Operator Analytics Polish (2026-05-18)
- Added a PC Dashboard `operator-insight-strip` powered by existing `getDashboardBundle/getDashboardData` summary fields: service pulse, cash today, risk queue, and AI + LINE loop.
- Added a Mobile `operator-pulse-card` on every home role (`tech`, `admin`, `acct`, `exec`) so mobile operators see Jobs, Cash, SLA, Billing, Stock, Vision, and LINE pressure before drilling into menus.
- Improved Executive Command Center button semantics with `type="button"` and `aria-label` so keyboard/focus QA remains stable after dashboard polish.
- Added responsive styling in `pwa/dashboard_shared.css` and `pwa/mobile_glass.css` without adding new backend calls or write paths.
- Added `scripts/sprint122_dashboard_operator_analytics_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the dashboard operator analytics polish.

### Phase 121 Performance/Accessibility Pass (2026-05-18)
- Hardened mobile page routing in `pwa/app.js` with `markPageLoading`, `markPageReady`, `aria-busy`, `data-page-state`, and a loading watchdog that replaces silent blank content with a diagnostic fallback.
- Added mobile CSS guardrails in `pwa/mobile_glass.css`: 44px minimum tap targets, `touch-action: manipulation`, visible focus rings, reduced-motion support, and loading diagnostic styles.
- Added PC section busy/ready state in `pwa/dashboard_pc_core.js` and PC shared CSS guardrails in `pwa/dashboard_shared.css`.
- Added `scripts/sprint121_performance_accessibility_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the performance/accessibility pass.

### Phase 120 Settings/Admin Runtime Hardening (2026-05-18)
- Hardened `pwa/section_settings.js` so PC Settings no longer seeds fake healthy/user data. The page now renders a checking state and hydrates live `health` and `listUsers` after the section is opened.
- The PC Settings maintenance surface now hydrates four live panels together: system summary, Runtime Self-Test, Data Repair Console, and Operations Diagnostics.
- Kept Data Repair destructive execution gated by `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR` and `archive_delete_orphan_billing_row`.
- Added `scripts/sprint120_settings_admin_runtime_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the Settings/Admin runtime hardening.

### Phase 119 Inventory/PO/Warranty Workflow Hardening (2026-05-18)
- Hardened `pwa/purchase_order.js` so Purchase Order fallback uses the unified `window.callAPI` bridge when `callApi` is not ready, and PO no longer falls back to `AI_EXECUTOR`.
- Hardened `pwa/section_warranty.js` so Warranty detail opens from the loaded list cache first and only uses `getWarrantyByJobId` with a `job_id` payload, preventing the previous `warranty_id` vs `job_id` contract mismatch.
- Added a Warranty detail modal with safe HTML escaping and a guarded `CLAIMED` status update path through `updateWarrantyStatus`.
- Added `scripts/sprint119_inventory_po_warranty_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0730` so mobile/PC clients pick up the Inventory/PO/Warranty hardening.

### Phase 118 Live Deploy Gate Repair (2026-05-18)
- Live browser check confirmed GitHub Pages was still serving old PWA assets with `t=20260516_0845`, while repository HEAD was already `8dc362c`.
- GitHub Actions API showed the latest Auto Deploy run failed in `Validate Code`; Deploy PWA was skipped.
- Root cause: `scripts/regression-guard.sh` changed to include Sprint 113-117, but `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5` still contained the previous checksum. `guard-self-test.sh` blocked deploy exactly as designed.
- Updated `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5` with the new `regression-guard.sh` hash and verified `bash scripts/guard-self-test.sh` passes 8/8.
- GitHub Actions deploy succeeded after the checksum fix, and `node scripts/pages_deploy_verify.js` confirmed Pages was serving the Sprint 113-117 build.
- Live protected PC click-through passed for Jobs, Billing, Reports, AI Vision, LINE Center, and Settings/Data Repair. Billing correctly disables detail/QR buttons for rows without `Job_ID`; Reports billing drilldown shows `report-empty-state`; Settings shows Data Repair candidates.
- Live mobile More-menu click-through passed for Billing, Reports, AI Vision, LINE Center, and Admin Panel. Sprint 118 also hardens quick action modal switching so `openNewJob` and `addCustomer` close peer action modals before opening their own form.
- Bumped PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260518_0345` for the mobile quick-action modal switching fix.

### Phase 117 Vision + LINE Operational Loop (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint117_vision_line_operational_loop_audit.js` to keep AI Vision and LINE Center preview-first and confirmation-gated.
- Guarded Vision suggestion flow: `previewVisionSuggestion` must run before `executeVisionSuggestion`, and execution must include `EXECUTE_VISION_SUGGESTION`.
- Guarded operator handoffs from Vision to Jobs timeline, Billing, and Reports through `linkLastVisionToJobTimeline`, `goVisionBilling`, and `goVisionReports`.
- Guarded LINE operational loop: route matrix, preview, queue test, and send-with-confirmation must remain available.
- Wired Sprint 117 into `pwa_static_guard.js`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 116 Reports Drilldown (2026-05-18)
- Hardened `pwa/reports.js` Billing report drilldown so a successful summary with no detail records shows a diagnostic `report-empty-state` instead of looking like a blank menu.
- The empty state now tells the operator to check date range, Billing date/status/amount fields, or Data Repair Console.
- Added `scripts/sprint116_reports_drilldown_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and auto-deploy syntax checks.

### Phase 115 Billing Resilience (2026-05-18)
- Hardened `pwa/billing_section.js` so incomplete Billing rows no longer open broken detail or PromptPay QR actions when `Job_ID` is missing.
- Added `billing-row-incomplete` marker and disabled action buttons with `Missing Job_ID - open Data Repair Console` guidance.
- Added safe inline Job ID escaping through `_billingInlineArg()` for Billing row action buttons.
- Added `scripts/sprint115_billing_resilience_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and auto-deploy syntax checks.

### Phase 114 Jobs Workflow Polish (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint114_jobs_workflow_polish_audit.js` to guard PC/mobile Jobs detail/timeline/Vision/Billing continuity.
- The guard verifies PC Jobs has detail, timeline, Vision, Billing, quick note, and status transition handoffs.
- The guard verifies Mobile Jobs keeps timeline, billing, Vision, and current job context.
- Wired Sprint 114 into static guard, regression guard, and auto-deploy syntax checks.

### Phase 113 Repair Console Live QA (2026-05-18)
- Added `scripts/sprint113_repair_console_live_qa.js` to guard Repair Console live readiness without executing production repair.
- The guard verifies Mobile Admin Repair tab, PC Settings Repair panel, exact confirmation gate, narrow repair action, and single cache timestamp.
- Bumped PWA build/cache timestamp to `20260518_0345` so GitHub Pages/service worker clients pick up Sprint 113-117 UI fixes.
- Wired Sprint 113 into static guard, regression guard, and auto-deploy syntax checks.

### Phase 112 Admin Repair Console UI (2026-05-18)
- Added a Mobile Admin `Repair` tab in `pwa/admin_panel.js`. It calls `getDataRepairStatus` and `previewDataRepair`, shows candidate counts, executable count, archive/audit sheets, candidate preview fields, and missing field badges.
- Added a PC Settings Data Repair panel in `pwa/section_settings.js` through `settings-data-repair-content` and `hydrateSettingsDataRepairPanel()`.
- Both PC and mobile execute paths require the exact phrase `EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR`, show an additional browser confirmation, and call `executeDataRepair` only with `archive_delete_orphan_billing_row`.
- Review-only report/backfill candidates are displayed but do not get an execute button.
- Added `scripts/sprint112_admin_repair_console_audit.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, and auto-deploy syntax checks.
- Bumped PWA build/cache timestamp to `20260518_0345` so GitHub Pages/service worker clients pick up the new Admin/Settings repair UI.

### Phase 111 Controlled Data Repair Execution (2026-05-17)
- Added `DataRepairConsole.gs` to root and `clasp-ready` with three protected actions: `previewDataRepair`, `getDataRepairStatus`, and `executeDataRepair`.
- `previewDataRepair` is read-only and reports incomplete Billing rows plus the Reports daily-revenue business-review candidate.
- `getDataRepairStatus` exposes the repair version, candidate count, archive/audit sheet names, and required confirmation phrase.
- `executeDataRepair` is blocked unless `execute=true`, a current `repair_id` is supplied, and `confirm=EXECUTE_REVIEWED_DATA_REPAIR`.
- Automatic execution is intentionally narrow: only orphan `DB_BILLING` rows with no `Billing_ID` and no `Job_ID` can be archived then deleted. Report revenue gaps and rows with usable identifiers remain manual-review/backfill only.
- Registered repair support sheets in `docs/database_schema_registry.json` and `CONFIG.SUPPORT_SHEETS`: `DB_DATA_REPAIR_ARCHIVE` and `DB_DATA_REPAIR_AUDIT`.
- Routed the repair actions through `RouterSplit.gs` and added them to the PWA API contract/admin surface. `executeDataRepair` is destructive and marked `smoke:false`.
- Added `scripts/sprint111_controlled_data_repair_execution.js` and wired it into static guard, regression guard, auto-deploy syntax checks, and GAS source alignment.
- Pushed `clasp-ready` source and redeployed the existing production Web App to **@614** with `Sprint 111 controlled data repair execution`; public health/version smoke passed and protected `getDataRepairStatus` / `previewDataRepair` returned JSON successfully with a fresh admin session.
- Safety model: preview first, owner confirmation, archive-before-change, audit log, then delete only the validated orphan Billing row. No real production repair has been executed by this sprint unless a future operator explicitly calls the protected action with the required confirmation.

### Phase 110 GAS @613 Protected Live Recheck (2026-05-17)
- Pushed the normalized `clasp-ready` source to Google Apps Script and updated the existing production Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` to **@613** with `Sprint 110 sheet context live deployment`.
- Kept the production URL unchanged: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA/exec`.
- Verified public health/version and protected live menus with a fresh admin session without exposing the session token.
- Protected checks passed for Dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Warranty, AI Vision, LINE Command Center, and Admin security status.
- Sprint 104 and Sprint 105 record/detail guards remain **100/100**; Billing detail still skips safely when the only live Billing source row has no usable `Job_ID`.
- Sprint 106/107/109 confirm two remaining data-repair tasks: incomplete `DB_BILLING` row 1 and empty current-month daily revenue records. Both remain read-only/manual-review with archive-before-change policy.
- Vision runtime protected suite passed after @613, including dashboard stats, pipeline version, learning version, field context, action suggestions, and review queue.

### Phase 109 Sheet Context + Data Repair Console Plan (2026-05-17)
- Normalized production sheet access so root and `clasp-ready` modules use `getComphoneSheet()` / `findSheetByName()` instead of active-spreadsheet context for backup, LINE chat history, performance metrics, predictive analytics, retail sale, and security audit paths.
- Removed legacy sheet-name usage from the guarded production paths: `DB_JOBS` -> `DBJOBS`, `DB_STOCK_MOVES` -> `DB_STOCK_MOVEMENTS`, `DB_WARRANTY` -> `DB_WARRANTIES`, `Inventory` -> `DB_INVENTORY`, and `System_Logs` -> `SYSTEM_LOGS`.
- Updated `findSheetByName()` in root and `clasp-ready/Utils.gs` so old callers benefit from `findComphoneSheetByName()` alias resolution.
- Upgraded `scripts/sprint108_database_schema_registry_guard.js` with `COMPHONE_SCHEMA_STRICT=1`; current normal and strict runs both pass **100/100** with **0 warnings** and **0 failures**.
- Added `scripts/sprint109_data_repair_console_plan.js`, a read-only operator plan that turns Sprint 106/107 reports into archive-before-change repair tasks ordered by Jobs, Billing, Reports, Inventory/PO, and AI Vision/LINE.
- Wired Sprint 109 into `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 108 Database Schema Registry Guard (2026-05-17)
- Added `docs/database_schema_registry.json` as the canonical registry for the single production Spreadsheet, official tables, support tables, legacy aliases, and sheet creation policy.
- Added `SHEET_ALIASES`, `SUPPORT_SHEETS`, `getCanonicalSheetName()`, and `findComphoneSheetByName()` to both root `Config.gs` and `clasp-ready/Config.gs`.
- Added `scripts/sprint108_database_schema_registry_guard.js`, a static read-only guard that scans GAS sheet references, validates the registered production Spreadsheet ID, blocks unregistered `DB_*` sheet names, and reports legacy aliases / `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` usage as cleanup backlog.
- Sprint 108 guard currently reports **90/100**, **0 failures**, and warning-only backlog for legacy aliases (`DB_JOBS`, `DB_STOCK_MOVES`, `DB_WARRANTY`, `Inventory`, `System_Logs`) plus modules still using `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()`.
- Wired Sprint 108 into `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 107 Controlled Data Cleanup / Backfill Plan (2026-05-17)
- Added `scripts/sprint107_controlled_data_cleanup_plan.js`, a read-only planner that converts Sprint 106 warnings into manual cleanup/backfill actions.
- The planner keeps production mutation blocked by default. `COMPHONE_DATA_CLEANUP=1` is intentionally blocked until a future archive-before-change backend action exists and is reviewed.
- Protected Sprint 107 plan from the latest Sprint 106 report produced **2 manual actions**:
  - `DB_BILLING` row 1: missing `Billing_ID`, `Job_ID`, and `Payment_Status`; recommended action is owner review and archive/delete only if confirmed as an orphan row.
  - Current-month reports: `getReportData(period=month)` has no daily revenue records; recommended action is business verification before editing reports code.
- The planner reuses existing smoke cleanup safety principles: marker-gated cleanup, archive-before-delete, and explicit confirmation gates.
- Wired Sprint 107 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 106 Production Data Quality Guard (2026-05-17)
- Added `scripts/sprint106_production_data_quality_guard.js`, a CI-safe, token-aware read-only guard for production data quality across Jobs, Billing, and Reports.
- The guard records safe metadata only: row numbers and field-presence booleans, not customer names, phone numbers, tokens, or financial details.
- Protected Sprint 106 run with a fresh admin session passed structurally with **100/100** and **0 live failures**, while reporting **2 non-blocking data warnings**:
  - `DB_BILLING` currently returns 1 Billing row with missing `Billing_ID`, `Job_ID`, and `Payment_Status`, so Billing detail drilldown cannot select a safe real source record.
  - Current-month `getReportData` is healthy but returns 0 daily revenue records; verify whether this matches actual business activity for the period.
- The guard can be made strict for controlled data-cleanup windows by setting `COMPHONE_DATA_QUALITY_FAIL_ON_WARN=1`.
- Wired Sprint 106 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 105 Record Detail Completeness (2026-05-17)
- Added `scripts/sprint105_record_detail_completeness.js`, a CI-safe, token-aware read-only guard for the second click in the workflow: Jobs list -> timeline, Billing list -> detail, and Reports menu -> drilldown data.
- Promoted `listBillings` into the Billing menu actions in `pwa/api_contract.js`, so Billing list is now a first-class protected API contract instead of only appearing inside workflow metadata.
- Adjusted Sprint 104 Billing detail evidence to use the backend `getBilling({ job_id })` contract instead of trying to detail-read by `billing_id`.
- Protected Sprint 105 run with a fresh admin session passed **100/100**: `health`, `checkJobs`, `getJobTimeline`, `listBillings`, `getReportData`, `getDashboardBundle`, and `getDashboardData` all returned valid read shapes.
- Current production data note: `listBillings` returns a Billing row, but no row with a usable `Job_ID` is available for the optional `getBilling` detail read, so Billing detail is skipped safely without creating or mutating production data.
- Wired Sprint 105 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 104 Protected Browser Journey (2026-05-17)
- Added `scripts/sprint104_protected_browser_journey.js`, a token-aware read-only guard for the priority operator journey: dashboard, Jobs, Billing, Reports, AI Vision, LINE Center, and Settings.
- The guard runs static PC/mobile route, mount, renderer, More-sheet, last-page restore, and API-contract checks even without a token; CI stays safe by skipping protected live reads when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is absent.
- With a fresh admin session token kept only in process memory, the protected run passed **100/100**: `health`, `getVersion`, `getDashboardData`, `checkJobs`, `getJobStateConfig`, `getJobTimeline`, `listBillings`, `getReportData`, Vision stats/pipeline/review/context, LINE command/status/alert queue, and `getSecurityStatus`.
- `getBilling` is intentionally optional in this guard and skipped when no latest billing record is available, so the suite does not create or mutate production data.
- Wired Sprint 104 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 103 Visual Runtime Walkthrough (2026-05-17)
- Added `scripts/sprint103_visual_runtime_walkthrough.js`, a CI-safe visual/runtime contract audit for PC and Mobile menus.
- The guard verifies PC script order, dashboard shell anchors, every sidebar section/content mount, PC renderer routing, and prevention of the `#main-content` wipe regression.
- The guard verifies Mobile script order, bottom navigation, camera FAB, grouped More sheet, every restorable mobile page, UTF-8 Thai labels for critical menu text, last-page restore, and accidental-close/back protection.
- The guard keeps the service-to-cash command surfaces visible: Jobs, Billing, Reports, AI Vision, and LINE Center.
- Wired Sprint 103 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.
- Local browser evidence captured the PC login shell from `dashboard_pc.html`; the CI-safe Sprint 103 audit passed **100/100**.

### Phase 102 Live UX Menu Runtime Stability (2026-05-17)
- Hardened PC dashboard navigation so renderers write into stable section mounts (`*-content`) instead of replacing `#main-content`; this prevents Settings/Backup-style pages from destroying other menu sections after navigation.
- Hardened `pwa/section_backup.js` to render into `#backup-content` first, preserving the PC dashboard shell.
- Hardened mobile restore/deep-link behavior with `getNavButtonForPage()`, so nested pages under More (Billing, Reports, Vision, LINE Center, Admin, etc.) restore with the correct active navigation state after reopening the PWA.
- Added `scripts/sprint102_live_ux_menu_audit.js`, covering mobile restorable pages, grouped More menu, accidental-exit protection, PC section mounts/routes, priority real modules, and protected live read-shape checks.
- Wired Sprint 102 into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.
- Protected live Sprint 102 run with a fresh admin session passed **10/10** priority read checks: dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin.

### Phase 101 Controlled Write Lifecycle QA (2026-05-17)
- Ran the protected write smoke with explicit gates: `COMPHONE_WRITE_SMOKE=1` and `COMPHONE_WRITE_SMOKE_CONFIRM=CREATE_TEST_RECORDS`.
- Verified the complete service-to-cash write lifecycle: create customer, open job, idempotent replay, read-back, add quick note, safe status transition, timeline read-back, create billing, billing idempotent replay, getBilling, and listBillings.
- Ran cleanup with explicit gates: `COMPHONE_SMOKE_CLEANUP=1` and `COMPHONE_SMOKE_CLEANUP_CONFIRM=REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`; reviewed smoke Job/Customer rows were archive-before-delete cleaned.
- Hardened `BillingCore.gs` in root and `clasp-ready/` so billing rows persist `options.notes`, allowing future smoke billing rows to carry cleanup markers.
- Hardened `scripts/pwa_smoke_cleanup_plan.js` so it merges IDs from `test_reports/pwa_write_smoke_latest.json`, not only broad list scans.
- Added `scripts/sprint101_write_lifecycle_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.

### Phase 100 Operator Menu Click-Through QA (2026-05-16)
- Live browser click-through verified the priority PC/mobile operator surfaces: Jobs, Billing, Reports, AI Vision, and LINE Center.
- Promoted Reports into the Executive Command Center so Jobs/Billing/Reports sit together as the primary service-to-cash operating flow.
- Added `scripts/sprint100_operator_menu_audit.js`, a skip-safe CI guard that statically validates priority menu surfaces and runs protected read checks when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is supplied.
- Wired Sprint 100 audit into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.
- Updated PWA cache/build timestamp to `20260516_0845` so GitHub Pages serves the new Dashboard command tile.

### Phase 99 Live Readiness + Cache Freshness (2026-05-16)
- Live browser QA found PC/mobile could still receive stale GitHub Pages assets because the PWA query timestamp and service-worker cache were still `20260513_2005` even after Sprint 98 code landed.
- Updated mobile/PC asset query strings, `VERSION_CONFIG.buildTimestamp`, and `sw.js` cache to `20260516_0815` / `comphone-v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening-20260516_0815`.
- Added legacy mobile quick-action migration so devices that saved the old default `openNewJob/addCustomer/jobs/crm` are upgraded to the new field-operator default `openNewJob/addCustomer/jobs/billing/vision/line-center`, while custom user selections remain untouched.
- Added `scripts/sprint99_live_readiness_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh`, `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`, and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`.
- Local Sprint 99 Live Readiness Audit passed **100/100** before full regression.

### Phase 98 Operator Workflow Polish (2026-05-16)
- Hardened Jobs/Billing operator handoffs: mobile Job Detail now remembers the active job and exposes Timeline, Billing, and Vision shortcuts; PC status transitions require a final explicit confirmation.
- Rebalanced mobile quick actions toward field operations: Open Job, Add Customer, Jobs, Billing, AI Vision, and LINE Center, with Vision/LINE treated as restorable More-menu pages.
- Upgraded the mobile/PC dashboard surface with an Executive Command Center covering Jobs, Billing, PO, Inventory risk, Vision review, and LINE alerts.
- Added a LINE Role Routing Matrix plus a safe queued test alert entry inside LINE Center.
- Added an AI Vision Operational Loop panel and automatic job-context restoration from the current job/vision context.
- Added `scripts/sprint98_operator_workflow_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`.

### Phase 97 Production Safety Harness Completion (2026-05-16)
- Added `scripts/pwa_line_room_smoke.js` to close the remaining LINE validation gap: protected room status, command-center payload, and dry-run message preview are verified by default.
- Real LINE room pushes now have their own explicit gate: `COMPHONE_LINE_SEND=1`, `COMPHONE_LINE_SEND_CONFIRM=SEND_TEST_LINE_MESSAGE`, and `COMPHONE_LINE_TEST_ROOMS`.
- Wired the LINE room smoke into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` and `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js`, so future agents cannot remove the LINE safety harness silently.

### Phase 96 Read Dashboard Cache Hardening + Full QA Sweep (2026-05-15)
- Hardened high-traffic read dashboards with short Script Cache coverage: CRM metrics, Vision dashboard stats, and LINE Command Center.
- Promoted `CRM.gs` into the blocking GAS source alignment list so root and `clasp-ready/` cannot drift silently on CRM read surfaces.
- Production GAS was pushed and existing Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` was updated to **@612** with `Sprint 96 Read dashboard cache hardening`.
### Phase 95 Jobs Read Cache Hardening + Full QA Sweep (2026-05-15)
- Hardened `JobsHandler.gs` in root and `clasp-ready/` so `checkJobs` honors `limit`, reads recent jobs first, and uses a 60s Script Cache keyed by search/limit.
- Cache writes are wrapped in a safe try/catch so large Jobs payloads never break the read endpoint.
- Production GAS was pushed and existing Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` was updated to **@611** with `Sprint 95 Jobs read cache hardening`.
### Phase 94 PO Read Cache Hardening + Full QA Sweep (2026-05-15)
- Hardened `InventoryPO.gs` in root and `clasp-ready/` so `listPurchaseOrders` uses a 60s Script Cache keyed by status/limit, reducing repeated protected menu latency after the first read.
- Cache writes are wrapped in a safe try/catch so large PO payloads never break the read endpoint.
- Production GAS was pushed and existing Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` was updated to **@610** with `Sprint 94 PO read cache hardening`.

### Phase 92 Blueprint Reconciliation (2026-05-15)
- Reconciled stale historical BLUEPRINT sections that still claimed old GAS `@506`, old production URLs, unresolved login/splash blockers, and old Phase 35 pending items.
- Updated watchlists to distinguish current blockers from historical findings, so Hermes/Codex/future agents do not restart already-closed recovery work.
- Current source of truth remains GitHub `main`, PWA v5.18.34, and GAS production deployment `@614`.

### Phase 91 Write-Smoke Lifecycle Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Expanded `scripts/pwa_write_smoke.js` so the gated write smoke now covers safe Jobs workflow handoffs after opening a test job: `addQuickNote`, an early safe `transitionJob` step, and `getJobTimeline` read-back verification.
- Kept payment and LINE-send style writes outside the default write smoke because those can trigger real customer/team notifications. Those paths remain guarded by explicit production/staging runbooks.
- Expanded `SmokeCleanup.gs` at root and `clasp-ready/SmokeCleanup.gs` so reviewed smoke cleanup can archive/delete smoke rows in `DB_BILLING` and `DB_PURCHASE_ORDERS`, not only Jobs and Customers.
- Expanded `scripts/pwa_smoke_cleanup_plan.js` to scan `listBillings` directly, and promoted `SmokeCleanup.gs` into the blocking `scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` list so root and deploy source cannot drift silently.
- Expanded static/UI guards to block regressions in write-smoke job handoffs and cleanup lifecycle coverage.
- Production GAS was pushed and existing Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` was updated to **@609** with `Sprint 91 Write-smoke lifecycle hardening`.

### Phase 90 Deploy-GAS CI Secret Gate Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy-gas.yml` so missing, invalid, or malformed `CLASPRC_JSON` no longer makes the validation job fail red. The workflow now completes validation and sets `should_deploy=false`, clearly skipping GAS deploy until the secret is configured.
- The production deployment path is still strict when `CLASPRC_JSON` exists and is valid: it proceeds to `clasp push`, creates a version, and deploys through the protected production environment exactly as before.
- This avoids noisy failed deploy-gas runs after local/manual GAS deploys while keeping the required secret documented. To re-enable automatic GAS deploy in GitHub Actions, set repository secret `CLASPRC_JSON` to the raw local `~/.clasprc.json` content.

### Phase 89 Dashboard Performance Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Hardened `Dashboard.gs` so legacy `getDashboardData()` now uses the single-pass `getDashboardBundle()` fast path first, stores a 60s compatibility cache, and only falls back to the old multi-scan implementation if the bundle path fails.
- Hardened `DashboardBundle.gs` sheet discovery to support production sheet names such as `DB_INVENTORY` and `DB_BILLING` plus legacy aliases, preventing fast bundle responses from returning thin/empty dashboard summaries.
- Synced `Dashboard.gs` and `DashboardBundle.gs` across root and `clasp-ready/`, then expanded `scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` so both Dashboard files are now blocking alignment checks.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: `gas_source_alignment` OK across 11 blocking GAS files, `gas_syntax_guard` OK for 90 GAS files, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, `drift-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.
- Production GAS was pushed and existing Web App deployment `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA` was updated to **@608** with `Sprint 89 Dashboard performance hardening`.
- Post-deploy verification on 2026-05-15: temporary admin session smoke showed `getDashboardData` fresh path at 8.8s wall time with backend `_elapsed_ms=3686`, then cached calls at about 3.4s wall time with backend `_elapsed_ms=30-88`. Sprint 87 protected live QA rerun reports **13 pass, 0 slow, 0 fail** and Dashboard `getDashboardData` at **3726ms**.

### Phase 88 Protected Live QA Evidence (2026-05-15)
- Ran Sprint 87 Protected Live QA with a short-lived admin session token kept only in process environment. No real session token was written to repo files, reports, or BLUEPRINT.
- Live protected read suite result: **12 pass, 1 slow, 0 fail, 0 skipped**. Public health/version passed. Protected dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Warranty, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin security read endpoints all returned HTTP 200 with valid response shapes.
- The only warning is dashboard latency: `getDashboardData` took about **12.2s**, crossing the Sprint 87 slow threshold of 12s. This is operationally usable but should be optimized next because Dashboard PC/mobile depend on it during the first screen load.
- Follow-up protected `pwa_api_smoke.js` also passed with the temporary token: dashboard, CRM, Inventory, PO, Reports, Vision stats/version, LINE Command Center/status, and Admin security status all OK.
- Next recommended sprint: Dashboard data performance hardening. Prioritize backend aggregation/cache strategy for `getDashboardData`, then frontend progressive rendering so PC/mobile first screen does not feel stuck during GAS cold starts.

### Phase 87 Protected Live QA Runbook (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint87_protected_live_qa_runbook.js` and wired it into `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` plus `scripts/regression-guard.sh`.
- The runbook is safe for CI: when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set it writes a skipped report and exits OK. When a fresh admin session token is supplied, it runs read-only protected checks for dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Warranty, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin security status.
- Reports are generated at `test_reports/sprint87_protected_live_qa_runbook_latest.json` and `test_reports/sprint87_protected_live_qa_runbook_latest.md`, with pass/slow/fail counts, operator commands, and per-menu recommendations. Real tokens must remain local shell env only and must never be committed.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: Sprint 87 skip-safe runbook OK without token, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.

### Phase 86 Operator UX QA Checklist (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint86_operator_ux_qa_checklist.js` and wired it into `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` plus `scripts/regression-guard.sh`. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- The checklist covers PC/mobile entrypoint load order, PC sidebar routes, mobile page containers and More sheet, mobile dashboard quick actions, Jobs/CRM/Billing chain, Inventory/PO/Warranty/Reports chain, Settings recovery tools, Sprint 85 live smoke readiness, and browser-smoke regression coverage.
- Generated operator-facing reports: `test_reports/sprint86_operator_ux_qa_latest.json` and `test_reports/sprint86_operator_ux_qa_latest.md`, including the recommended manual walkthrough order.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: Sprint 86 Operator UX QA 100/100, `python scripts/browser-smoke-test.py` OK, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, Sprint 85 live public smoke OK with protected suite skipped due to missing `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.

### Phase 85 Live Mobile Menu Smoke Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint85_live_mobile_menu_smoke.js` and wired it into `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` plus `scripts/regression-guard.sh`.
- The smoke runs public `health` and `getVersion` on every run, then runs protected read-only mobile menu checks only when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set. This keeps CI safe while giving operators a one-command live protected menu check.
- Protected read-only suite covers dashboard, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Warranty, Vision, LINE Center, and Admin security status with response-shape validators and concise summaries.
- Report outputs: `test_reports/sprint85_live_mobile_menu_smoke_latest.json` and `test_reports/sprint85_live_mobile_menu_smoke_latest.md`.
- Verification on 2026-05-15 without a session token: public live health/version OK, protected suite skipped with an explicit `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN is not set` marker, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.

### Phase 84 Mobile Secondary Workflows Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint84_mobile_secondary_workflows_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies Inventory -> PO -> Warranty -> Reports mobile surfaces and contracts. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Hardened `pwa/purchase_order.js` with `ensurePOModalShell()` so PO detail and create flows recover `modal-po` and `modal-create-po` dynamically when static modal shells are absent from `index.html`.
- Added `client_request_id` and `source: mobile_po` to the mobile `createPurchaseOrder` path while keeping `receivePurchaseOrder` behind explicit confirmation.
- Added `loadWarrantyPage()` alias in `pwa/section_warranty.js` so Warranty is a first-class mobile route instead of relying on fallback route behavior.
- Expanded `pwa/api_contract.js` for PO write actions and Warranty read/write actions: `createPurchaseOrder`, `receivePurchaseOrder`, `listWarranties`, `getWarrantyByJobId`, `createWarranty`, and `updateWarrantyStatus`.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: Sprint 84 audit 100/100, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, `pwa_menu_journey_audit` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.

### Phase 83 Mobile Core Workflows Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint83_mobile_core_workflows_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies the highest-value mobile chain: Jobs -> CRM -> Billing. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Hardened `pwa/crm_attendance.js` with `normalizeMobileCustomer()` so mobile CRM correctly renders backend/sheet-style fields such as `customer_name`, `customer_id`, `customer_type`, `total_jobs`, `total_revenue`, and `created_at`.
- Updated mobile CRM customer detail and after-sales flows to create missing modal shells through `ensureActionModal()` instead of depending on removed static HTML modal containers.
- Updated the legacy `showAddCustomer()` path to delegate to the central `addCustomer()` workflow when available, keeping the Sprint 82 idempotent create-customer modal as the primary mobile entry.
- Added `client_request_id` and `source: mobile_crm` to `saveNewCustomerFromCRM()` so the legacy CRM write path is also idempotent if called directly.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: Sprint 83 audit 100/100, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, Sprint 82 audit 100/100, `ci_readiness_check` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK.

### Phase 82 Mobile Quick Actions Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Added `scripts/sprint82_mobile_quick_actions_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies mobile dashboard quick action buttons, central `runQuickAction()` dispatch, configurable max-6 shortcuts, Open Job/Add Customer modal workflows, idempotent write payloads, More-sheet grouped routing, API contract coverage, and CI coverage. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Hardened `pwa/app_home.js` quick action buttons with stable `type="button"`, `data-quick-action`, and `aria-label` attributes so browser smoke, support tooling, and accessibility tooling have durable handles.
- Hardened legacy `moreActions()` in `pwa/app_actions.js` so old callers open the modern grouped `showMoreMenu()` bottom sheet instead of trying to use a missing Bootstrap modal path that can render as a blank white sheet.
- Expanded `pwa/api_contract.js` CRM coverage with `createCustomer` as a destructive/write action, matching the mobile `addCustomer()` workflow and future smoke-test expectations.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: Sprint 82 audit 100/100, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, Sprint 80 Production Journey Audit OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, and `guard-self-test.sh` OK. Local browser check confirmed the mobile shell assets load from a clean local server; local login was not used as a pass/fail signal because localhost auth waited on the production backend response.

### Phase 81 Scheduled Session Backup Hardening (2026-05-15)
- Investigated the latest GitHub Actions state. Auto Deploy and Drive Backup Sync were green on commit `ab75f74`, while `Scheduled Session Backup` failed on the scheduled run from 2026-05-14 17:29 UTC.
- Root cause: `.gitignore` ignored the whole `backups/` directory while `.github/workflows/session-backup.yml` attempted `git add backups/session/`. This makes the scheduled backup job fail before it can commit the generated session backup.
- Updated `.gitignore` to keep the general `backups/` ignore while explicitly allowing `backups/session/*.md`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/session-backup.yml` to `git add -f backups/session/session_*.md backups/session/session_latest.md` and exit cleanly when `memory/session.md` is absent.
- Updated `scripts/ci_readiness_check.js` so future CI readiness checks assert that scheduled session backup files are allowed through `.gitignore` and force-added by the workflow.
- Verification on 2026-05-15: workflow YAML parse OK, `git add --dry-run backups/session/session_latest.md` OK, `ci_readiness_check` OK, `pwa_static_guard` OK, and `guard-self-test` OK.

### Phase 80 Production Journey + Deploy Validation Hardening (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint80_production_journey_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies PC section routing, mobile page containers, grouped mobile More-menu routing, last-page restore/back protection, Settings recovery tools, API contract journey coverage, deploy-gas validation stability, and CI coverage. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Fixed the PC Settings/version badge in `pwa/section_settings.js`. The badge now reports `API:OK/CHECK` and `CACHE:OK/CHECK`, matching the post-recovery direct `api_client.js` architecture, instead of showing stale `AI:FAIL | LOCK:FAIL` from removed executor paths.
- Added `scripts/gas_syntax_guard.js` and updated `.github/workflows/deploy-gas.yml` to use it. The workflow no longer uses a raw brace counter that can fail on valid Apps Script regex/string content. Local pre-deploy validation sequence passes: `gas_syntax_guard`, `regression-guard`, `drift-guard`, `guard-self-test`, `ci_readiness_check`, and `gas_source_alignment`.
- Browser QA on 2026-05-14 verified live mobile login, grouped More menu, mobile Reports page, live PC Settings page, and local fixed PC badge (`API:OK | CACHE:OK`) with no `AI:FAIL`/`LOCK:FAIL` false alarm.
- Verification on 2026-05-14: Sprint 80 audit 100/100, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `system_integrity_audit` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, full `regression-guard.sh` OK, protected `pwa_api_smoke` OK, protected `vision_runtime_smoke` OK, and protected Sprint 79 Vision+LINE live read audit 100/100. No Apps Script redeploy was required for Sprint 80 because backend production remained at @607.

### Phase 79 AI Vision + LINE Flow Hardening (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint79_vision_line_flow_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies PC/mobile Vision surfaces, Vision controlled execution, LINE room routing previews, LINE Command Center safe-send, alert operations, RouterSplit route coverage, API contract coverage, read-action classification, and optional live protected Vision/LINE reads. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Fixed LINE Command Center manual room messaging in both root and `clasp-ready/LineCommandCenter.gs`: `sendLineRoomMessage()` now calls `sendLinePush(message, groupId)` to match the production `Notify.gs` contract. Preview still runs first and production sends still require `SEND_LINE_ROOM_MESSAGE`.
- Added `scripts/gas_syntax_guard.js` and updated `.github/workflows/deploy-gas.yml` to use it instead of the old raw brace counter. This prevents valid Apps Script regex/string content from causing false pre-deploy failures while still blocking empty files, merge-conflict markers, unbalanced block comments, and malformed function declarations.
- Confirmed AI Vision controlled actions remain behind the safe chain: UI preview -> operator confirmation -> backend allowed-suggestion lookup -> `EXECUTE_VISION_SUGGESTION` confirmation gate -> audit/write/LINE routing.
- GAS source was pushed and production deployment updated to **@607** (`Sprint 79 Vision LINE flow hardening`). `pwa/gas_config.js` records the new deployment note/date while keeping the same production Web App URL.
- Verification on 2026-05-14: Sprint 79 static audit 100/100, protected live Vision+LINE read audit 100/100, `gas_syntax_guard` OK, `vision_runtime_smoke` OK, `pwa_api_smoke` OK, `pwa_static_guard` OK, `system_integrity_audit` OK, `pwa_functional_menu_audit` OK, `vision_capability_audit` OK, GAS source alignment OK, and full `regression-guard.sh` OK.

### Phase 78 Reports End-to-End Workflow Hardening (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint78_reports_e2e_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies PC/mobile Reports shell loading, real report renderer routing, Attendance/Jobs/Billing/Inventory report actions, Revenue API usage, Analytics backend routes, backend report engines, API contract coverage, and optional live protected reads. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Added `_normalizeReportData()` in `pwa/reports.js` so Billing report cards can consume both legacy `summary/records` responses and current backend `data.revenue/dailyRevenue` report responses.
- Updated `pwa/section_revenue.js` to call `getReportData({period:'month'})` first and normalize report output through `_normalizeRevenueReportData()` before falling back to dashboard data.
- Expanded `pwa/api_contract.js` Reports menu coverage to include `getAttendanceMonthlySummary`, `getDashboardBundle`, `inventoryOverview`, `analyzeBusiness`, and `getDashboardAnalytics`.
- Verification on 2026-05-14: Sprint 78 static audit 100/100, protected live Reports/Analytics audit 100/100, `pwa_api_smoke` OK, and full `regression-guard.sh` OK. No Apps Script redeploy was required because this sprint changed PWA/contract/guard files only.

### Phase 77 Billing End-to-End Workflow Hardening (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint77_billing_e2e_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies PC/mobile Billing surfaces, Jobs-to-Billing handoff, backend Billing routes, create/list/pay/QR/slip/receipt hooks, tax hooks, field contract normalization, and optional live protected Billing reads. Current result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- Fixed `pwa/billing_section.js` contract drift by adding `_normalizeBilling()`. The UI now accepts backend lowercase fields (`job_id`, `payment_status`, `total_amount`, etc.) while preserving legacy uppercase table/detail accessors.
- Fixed Billing payment math: PC mark-paid now sends the total paid amount (`totalForPayment`) instead of only `Balance_Due`, preventing partial-payment drift when a bill already has previous payment.
- Fixed PromptPay QR display compatibility: the UI now accepts `qr_url`, `qr_image_url`, or `promptpay_qr_url` from the backend.
- Restored the mobile Billing modal shell in `pwa/index.html` (`modal-billing` + `billing-modal-content`) so `openBillingModal()` from mobile Jobs/quick actions has a real mount point.
- Kept `pwa/section_billing.js` as a compatibility shim only, with no placeholder production data. Verification on 2026-05-14: Sprint 77 static audit 100/100, protected live Billing/Tax read audit 100/100, `pwa_api_smoke` OK, and full `regression-guard.sh` OK.

### Phase 76 Jobs End-to-End Workflow Hardening (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint76_jobs_e2e_audit.js` and wired it into `scripts/regression-guard.sh` plus `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml`. The guard verifies mobile Jobs shell/handlers, PC Jobs renderer/actions, Vision/Billing handoffs, backend Jobs routes, quick-note implementation, billing transition hooks, and API contract coverage. Current static result: **100/100**, **0 findings**.
- PC Jobs (`pwa/section_jobs.js`) now exposes a complete operator row/detail workflow: open/create job, detail modal, assign technician, quick note, timeline, status transition, Vision context handoff, and Billing modal/section handoff. The old undefined `_buildJobsTable()` reference was removed.
- Backend `addQuickNote(jobId, note, user)` is implemented in both root and `clasp-ready/JobStateMachine.gs`. It appends timestamped notes to `DBJOBS`, updates the row timestamp, writes `DB_JOB_LOGS`, and returns the updated job object.
- GAS source was pushed and production deployment updated to **@606** (`Sprint 76 Jobs E2E`). `pwa/gas_config.js` records the new deployment note/date while keeping the same production Web App URL.
- Verification on 2026-05-14: `pwa_static_guard`, `system_integrity_audit`, `pwa_functional_menu_audit`, Sprint 74, Sprint 75, Sprint 76, GAS source alignment, and full `regression-guard.sh` all passed.

### Phase 75 Jobs/Billing/Reports Focus + Smoke Cleanup Gate (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint75_jobs_billing_reports_audit.js` for the next menu-by-menu hardening sprint. It focuses on the highest-value operator chain: Jobs, Billing, and Reports. Current static result: **100/100**, **0 P0**, **0 P1**, **0 P2** findings.
- Fixed PC Billing rendering in `pwa/dashboard_pc_core.js`: the PC shell now supports renderers that paint directly into the DOM instead of forcing `undefined` into the section container.
- Replaced legacy `pwa/section_billing.js` prototype content with a compatibility shim. The stale fake billing rows and unfinished/coming-soon handlers are no longer part of the production runtime path.
- Added `SmokeCleanup.gs` at root and `clasp-ready/SmokeCleanup.gs`. `cleanupSmokeTestRecords` archives matching rows into `DB_SMOKE_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE` before deletion and will only delete requested records that still contain smoke markers (`AUTO WRITE SMOKE`, `WSMOKE_`, `PWA_WRITE_SMOKE`, or `smoke-test`).
- `scripts/pwa_smoke_cleanup_plan.js` remains review-first by default. Execution requires `COMPHONE_SMOKE_CLEANUP=1` and `COMPHONE_SMOKE_CLEANUP_CONFIRM=REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`; the backend action additionally requires `DELETE_REVIEWED_SMOKE_RECORDS`.
- Production cleanup executed on 2026-05-14 after GAS @605: jobs `J0022`, `J0021` and customers `C0003`, `C0002` were archived to `DB_SMOKE_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE` and deleted. A follow-up scan reports **0 smoke cleanup candidates**.
- Added `scripts/set_gas_secret.js` to set allowed GAS Script Properties through the protected admin API using environment variables only. No real Gemini/LINE secret value is stored in the repo.
- Gemini restored on 2026-05-14 under Apps Script Property `GEMINI_API_KEY` using the protected admin API. Follow-up `vision_runtime_smoke.js` passed public health/version plus protected Vision stats, pipeline version, learning version, field context, action suggestions, and review queue.

### Phase 74 Core System Sprint Audit (2026-05-14)
- Added `scripts/sprint74_core_audit.js` as the repo-level Code Intelligence Layer for release health. It checks source-of-truth drift, backend auth/API contracts, PC/mobile runtime scripts, last-page/last-section restore, service-worker repair safety, functional menu/data reality, write-flow idempotency, destructive action confirmation, AI Vision/LINE Center readiness, obvious secret leakage, CI/CD script coverage, and recovery documentation.
- Current audit result: **100/100**, **0 P0**, **0 P1**, **0 P2** findings. Generated reports: `test_reports/sprint74_core_audit_latest.json`, `test_reports/sprint74_core_audit_latest.md`, and `SPRINT_74_CORE_AUDIT.md`.
- `scripts/regression-guard.sh` now runs Sprint 74 Core System Audit, and `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` includes the new audit script in Node syntax checks. Guard checksum was updated in `scripts/.guard-checksums.md5`.
- Live protected API smoke was rerun with a short-lived admin session on 2026-05-14. Core protected menus passed: dashboard, CRM, inventory, purchase orders, reports, Vision stats/version, LINE Command Center/status, and admin security status.
- Smoke Cleanup Planner scanned production read APIs and still reports 4 review candidates from prior write-smoke activity: jobs `J0022`, `J0021` and customers `C0003`, `C0002`. Keep cleanup manual/review-first until the operator approves destructive cleanup mode.
- Remaining operator actions: restore the Gemini secret in Apps Script Properties for real Gemini Vision analysis, and keep all future Hermes/agent-assisted bulk edits gated by `node scripts/sprint74_core_audit.js` plus `bash scripts/regression-guard.sh`.

### Phase 73.2 Functional Menu QA + Data Reality Update (2026-05-13)
- Added `scripts/pwa_functional_menu_audit.js` to validate that required PC/mobile menus have real containers, renderers/loaders, API contracts, diagnostics surfaces, and no required production menu is left as a blank/coming-soon shell.
- Added `scripts/pwa_smoke_cleanup_plan.js`. Default mode is read-only and produces a review plan for smoke/test records. It found 4 production review candidates from the write-smoke harness: jobs `J0022`, `J0021` and customers `C0003`, `C0002`.
- PC `tax` now routes through the real `renderTaxSection()` implementation from `section_tax.js` instead of an inline minimal card.
- PC fallback text now says the module is not loaded and directs operators to Settings diagnostics, avoiding misleading "Coming soon" placeholders in production workflows.
- PC Settings now includes an Operations Diagnostics panel, diagnostics export JSON, and a safe PWA cache/service-worker repair button.
- Regression guard now runs the Functional Menu Audit and Smoke Cleanup Planner as part of the pre-deploy pack.

### Phase 73.1 Post-Recovery Hardening Update (2026-05-13)
- Live GitHub Pages now serves `v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening` and production GAS deployment `@604`.
- Mobile PWA login was verified with the production admin account and loads the operational dashboard after session creation.
- PC Dashboard was verified from the same production session and successfully calls `getDashboardBundle`.
- `pwa/pwa_install.js` now registers `sw.js` with the active cache/build version and repairs stale service worker registrations by unregistering old PWA workers and retrying once.
- `pwa/sw.js` now tolerates partial CDN/precache failures, deletes old caches during activation, avoids caching navigations as stale app shells, and falls back to `index.html` only when offline.
- `pwa/runtime_self_test.js` now treats missing Gemini key as a warning while keeping Vision stats/pipeline/learning endpoints as real failures. This prevents secret-readiness drift from blocking unrelated login/menu deployments.
- `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` now triggers on PWA, guard script, root GAS, and `clasp-ready` source changes so CI cannot miss deploy-critical drift.
- `.github/workflows/drive-sync.yml` now skips safely when Google Drive repository secrets are missing, keeping app deployment green while clearly reporting the backup configuration gap.
- Remaining operator action: restore Gemini secret in Apps Script Properties using one supported key name (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GEMINI_KEY`) and configure Google Drive backup secrets if GitHub Actions Drive backup is required.

### Phase 73 System Recovery Update (2026-05-13)
- Restored repository tree from stable commit `db942bd` after the Phase 74 branch reduced the tracked system from 502 files to 65 files.
- Preserved the damaged state before recovery in stash `pre-recovery-phase74-damaged-state-20260513` and branch `codex/safety-before-recovery-20260513`.
- Restored CI workflows, guard scripts, PWA modules, AI Vision/LINE Center surfaces, runtime self-test, offline/PWA install modules, and full `clasp-ready` GAS source set.
- Re-deployed recovered GAS source to deployment `@604`.
- `pwa/gas_config.js` now uses Web App deployment URL `AKfycbwN_mbyHOJ4vXRNpHjuN8dUFbXjERwtgTbNROt5_ynakfYm6Xv4RrgvhPMvI53lIhPWBA`, not the invalid script-id URL.
- Backend `health` and `getVersion` now return JSON again. Protected API smoke passes dashboard, CRM, inventory, PO, reports, Vision read endpoints, LINE Center, and admin.
- Remaining recovery item: restore Gemini secret in Apps Script Properties under `GEMINI_API_KEY` or another supported alias (`GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_KEY`) to make real Gemini Vision analysis ready.

### Phase 66 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **100/100 deploy-observability readiness**. CI now has explicit checks that distinguish missing files, stale checksums, source drift, missing secrets, and GitHub Pages CDN delay.
- Added `scripts/ci_readiness_check.js` to statically verify workflow script references, required guard files, `CLASPRC_JSON` coverage, and `clasp-ready/.clasp.json` availability without reading secret values.
- Added `scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` to compare deploy-root and `clasp-ready` GAS files. It blocks drift for current deploy-critical files (`Config.gs`, `RouterSplit.gs`, `LineCommandCenter.gs`) and reports historical drift in `Router.gs`, `Auth.gs`, and `VisionPipeline.gs` as warnings for a later cleanup phase.
- Added `scripts/pages_deploy_verify.js` to verify GitHub Pages is serving the committed PWA version, build timestamp, cache version, and production GAS URL. CDN delay is reported as `cdn_pending` instead of a false code failure.
- `auto-deploy.yml` now runs CI readiness, GAS alignment, and Pages freshness verification. `deploy-gas.yml` now runs CI readiness and GAS alignment after guard self-test.
- Browser Runtime Self-Test now checks LINE Command Center and GitHub Pages freshness from PC/Mobile Settings.
- `pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks releases if LINE Center or Pages freshness runtime checks are removed.

### Phase 65 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **100/100 command-center readiness**. PC and Mobile now have a shared LINE Center surface for room configuration visibility, alert queue monitoring, acknowledgement tracking, analytics, and safe manual room messaging.
- Added `LineCommandCenter.gs` at both deploy root and `clasp-ready/` so the actual GAS deployment path and working source stay aligned.
- New backend actions: `getLineCommandCenter`, `getLineRoomStatus`, `acknowledgeLineAlert`, `bulkAcknowledgeLineAlerts`, `queueLineCommandAlert`, `previewLineRoomMessage`, and `sendLineRoomMessage`.
- `sendLineRoomMessage` is guarded by explicit confirmation `SEND_LINE_ROOM_MESSAGE`; preview is available before push, and no LINE group IDs or tokens are exposed to the frontend.
- `pwa/section_line_center.js` renders the shared PC/Mobile LINE Center panel and calls the API actions explicitly so code-index and menu-integrity tools can verify the workflow.
- `api_contract.js`, `app.js`, `dashboard_pc.html`, `dashboard_pc_core.js`, `index.html`, `pwa_asset_manifest.js`, `pwa_static_guard.js`, and `system_integrity_audit.js` now include LINE Center routing and release checks.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@560`: backend version `5.18.14-line-command-center`, protected live checks for LINE room status, command center payload, and dry-run message preview passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 64 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 operator trust readiness**. Controlled execution now supports dry-run previews before final confirmation, so operators can see sheet writes and LINE rooms before committing.
- GAS `VisionPipeline.gs` exposes `previewVisionSuggestion()` and builds previews for timeline writes, human review, quick notes, job transitions, payment marking, and LINE notifications.
- Vision suggestions now carry `lineRooms` based on type/decision: QC -> TECHNICIAN, SLIP/payment -> ACCOUNTING, PRODUCT -> PROCUREMENT, high-risk failures -> EXECUTIVE.
- LINE dispatch uses resolved `LINE_GROUP_*` group IDs and direct push helpers with fallback logging, reducing ambiguity from duplicate notification wrappers.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` now displays preview details before executing destructive Vision suggestions.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@559`: backend version `5.18.13-vision-preview-line-router`, preview dry-run, LINE room routing/dedupe, protected API smoke, Vision Runtime smoke, Workflow smoke, and gated Vision E2E smoke passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 63 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 controlled-automation readiness**. AI Vision suggestions can now be executed only through a server whitelist, explicit confirmation phrase, and audit logging.
- GAS `VisionPipeline.gs` exposes `executeVisionSuggestion()` for controlled actions such as timeline link, human review, add job note, technician alert, guarded job-done transition, and guarded payment received.
- The execution layer rebuilds current suggestions on the server and refuses arbitrary action names, so the frontend cannot invent a write action.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` runs destructive suggestions through `executeVisionSuggestion()` and keeps local/navigation suggestions client-side.
- `api_contract.js` and PWA bridge helpers now track `executeVisionSuggestion` as a destructive gated Vision action.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@553`: backend version `5.18.12-vision-controlled-execution`, protected API smoke, Vision Runtime smoke, Workflow smoke, gated Vision E2E smoke, and negative confirmation-gate test passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 62 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 operator-assist readiness**. AI Vision now recommends next actions after analysis/review while keeping all write actions behind explicit user confirmation.
- GAS `VisionPipeline.gs` exposes `getVisionActionSuggestions()` to turn Vision decision, confidence, Job ID, and timeline context into safe next-action suggestions.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` now renders Suggested Next Actions on PC/Mobile and can run local navigation, context loading, copy result, review approval/rejection, and timeline linking through existing guarded handlers.
- `api_contract.js`, `app.js`, `app_actions.js`, and release guards now track `getVisionActionSuggestions` as a read-only Vision action.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@551`: backend version `5.18.11-vision-action-suggestions`, protected API smoke, Vision Runtime smoke with `getVisionActionSuggestions`, Workflow smoke, and gated Vision E2E smoke passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 61 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 field-job workflow readiness**. AI Vision can now carry Job ID and expected slip amount context into analysis, read related job/timeline context, and link reviewed Vision results back to the job timeline.
- GAS `VisionPipeline.gs` now supports top-level image payload compatibility, preserves `job_id` in `VISION_LOG`, exposes `getVisionFieldContext()`, and provides `linkVisionToJobTimeline()` for controlled timeline writes.
- `submitHumanReview()` can attach approved/rejected Vision decisions to a job timeline when a Job ID is available, keeping AI output auditable instead of isolated.
- `RouterSplit.gs`, `api_contract.js`, `app.js`, `vision_runtime_smoke.js`, `vision_capability_audit.js`, and `pwa_static_guard.js` now know the field-link actions.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` now has Job ID/expected amount controls, a Job Link & Timeline panel, result-level Link Timeline action, and queue-level context loading for both PC and Mobile.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@549`: backend version `5.18.10-vision-field-link`, protected API smoke, Vision Runtime smoke with `getVisionFieldContext`, Workflow smoke, and gated Vision E2E smoke passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 60 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 field-workflow readiness**. AI Vision now has user-facing result cards, a human review queue, and a gated E2E analysis smoke path.
- GAS `VisionPipeline.gs` now returns `visionLogId` after saving to `VISION_LOG` and exposes `getVisionReviewQueue()` for pending human-review work.
- `RouterSplit.gs` now routes `getVisionReviewQueue`; `Config.gs` backend version is `5.18.9-vision-review-queue`.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` now renders AI results as cards with decision, confidence, issues, extracted fields, approve/reject actions, and a live Human Review Queue panel.
- `submitHumanReview` is now reachable from the UI for both the latest analysis result and queued review items.
- Added `scripts/vision_e2e_smoke.js`. It is skip-safe by default and only runs image analysis when all three gates are set: `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COMPHONE_VISION_E2E=1`, `COMPHONE_VISION_E2E_CONFIRM=RUN_VISION_ANALYSIS`.
- `scripts/vision_runtime_smoke.js` now also checks `getVisionReviewQueue` when a token is present.
- Static/capability guards now enforce review queue coverage and gated E2E smoke coverage.
- Production deploy verified at GAS deployment `@547`: public health/getVersion, protected API/menu smoke, Vision Runtime smoke, Workflow smoke, and gated Vision E2E smoke passed on 2026-05-07.

### Phase 59 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **99/100 AI readiness visibility**. AI Vision now distinguishes between route availability and actual Gemini readiness, so users and release checks can see whether the Vision backend is configured for real AI work.
- `scripts/vision_runtime_smoke.js` now validates public `health.checks.config.gemini_ok` and records `gemini_ok`, `line_ok`, and missing config names in its JSON report without exposing secret values.
- `pwa/section_vision.js` now shows readiness badges for Gemini Vision and LINE in the AI Vision panel on PC and Mobile.
- `pwa/runtime_self_test.js` now checks Gemini readiness as part of the browser-side `ai-vision-runtime` test when a user session exists.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks releases if Vision readiness checks are removed from the UI/runtime smoke.
- Current production health check reports `gemini_ok=true`, `line_ok=true`, and no missing required config keys.

### Phase 58 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **98/100 runtime-verification readiness**. AI Vision now has read-only terminal smoke and browser-side Runtime Self-Test coverage, so failures in Vision stats/version/learning endpoints are visible before field users rely on the panel.
- Added `scripts/vision_runtime_smoke.js`. It checks public GAS health/version and, when `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, verifies protected `getVisionDashboardStats`, `getVisionPipelineVersion`, and `getVisionLearningVersion`.
- The smoke writes `test_reports/vision_runtime_smoke_latest.json` and is safe by default. Without a token it records a skip-safe protected row and still verifies public backend availability.
- `scripts/regression-guard.sh` now runs Vision runtime smoke after the structural Vision capability audit.
- `pwa/runtime_self_test.js` now includes `ai-vision-runtime`, allowing PC Settings and Mobile Profile Runtime Self-Test to verify AI Vision from the live browser session after login.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks removal of the Vision runtime smoke script or browser-side AI Vision runtime check.
- No destructive Vision image analysis is run by automated guards. Image analysis remains user-confirmed from the UI or explicitly enabled by a future test harness.

### Phase 57 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **98/100 functional readiness**. AI Vision is no longer only backend-ready; PC and Mobile now expose an operations panel that users can open from navigation.
- Added `pwa/section_vision.js` as the shared Vision UI module for PC and Mobile.
- PC Dashboard now has an `AI Vision` sidebar item and `section-vision` content area. The panel can refresh Vision stats, check backend Vision versions, jump to billing/reports, and run a guarded image analysis pipeline after a user chooses a file and confirms.
- Mobile PWA now has `page-vision`, a More menu entry, and an optional quick action entry. It can refresh Vision stats, open camera/slip capture, and run the same guarded image analysis panel.
- `pwa/pwa_asset_manifest.js`, `pwa/index.html`, and `pwa/dashboard_pc.html` now load/precache `section_vision.js` so installed PWA clients can use the panel offline-first after update.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks releases where the Vision UI script is not loaded/pre-cached or does not call the Vision stats/pipeline actions.
- Destructive Vision analysis still requires explicit user confirmation in the UI. Real secrets remain outside the repository.

### Phase 56 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **98/100 structural readiness**. AI Vision now has its own capability audit so the system can detect missing Vision routes, PWA call sites, backend handlers, and contract drift before users hit empty menus or broken image flows.
- Added `scripts/vision_capability_audit.js`. It writes `test_reports/vision_capability_latest.json` and `test_reports/vision_capability_latest.md`.
- `pwa/api_contract.js` now includes the `vision` menu and `vision_ai` workflow: dashboard stats, pipeline version, learning version, photo gallery reads, plus gated destructive actions for photo processing, upload, pipeline runs, QC, slip verification, and human review.
- `pwa/app.js` now classifies `getVisionDashboardStats`, `getVisionPipelineVersion`, and `getVisionLearningVersion` as read-only actions so temporary Vision read failures do not become offline write queue records.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks releases that remove AI Vision contract coverage, read-action classification, or the Vision audit script.
- `scripts/regression-guard.sh` now runs the Vision capability audit as part of the pre-deploy guard pack.
- Current Vision capabilities in code: job photo classification, Drive/photo queue processing, before/after collage data, QC pipeline, payment slip AI verification, Vision dashboard stats, human review/learning loop, AgentGateway Vision roles, geofence helper integration, and LINE notification helper integration.
- Secret policy remains unchanged: real `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`, LINE tokens, and session tokens must stay in GAS Script Properties/private vaults. BLUEPRINT records key names and integration surfaces only, not secret values.
- Runtime note: protected Vision API execution requires a real `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN` in the current terminal process; without it the local audit still validates code/contract structure but does not call production protected Vision endpoints.

### Phase 55 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **97/100**. The system now has a gated write-smoke harness so write workflows can be tested deliberately without accidental production writes during normal guard runs.
- Added `scripts/pwa_write_smoke.js`.
- Default mode is non-destructive dry-run. It writes `test_reports/pwa_write_smoke_latest.json` and exits OK without creating records.
- Destructive mode requires all three explicit inputs: `COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COMPHONE_WRITE_SMOKE=1`, and `COMPHONE_WRITE_SMOKE_CONFIRM=CREATE_TEST_RECORDS`.
- When enabled, it creates tagged smoke customer/job/billing records and immediately repeats each write with the same `client_request_id` to verify idempotent replay.
- All smoke records include `source=pwa_write_smoke`, `smoke_id`, and `AUTO TEST ONLY` notes for manual inspection/cleanup.
- `scripts/regression-guard.sh` now runs the write-smoke safety gate in dry-run mode.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks removal of write-smoke gating and idempotency checks.

### Phase 54 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **97/100**. The next production risk after menu/API stability was duplicate writes from double taps, retry, or offline replay. This phase hardens those write paths.
- Mobile `openJob` and `createCustomer` now attach `client_request_id`, record `source`, block double submit, and refresh live data after success.
- PC/PWA billing creation now attaches `client_request_id`, blocks double submit, and sends normalized billing payload metadata.
- GAS `openJob`, `createCustomer`, and object-style `createBilling` now support idempotent replay through Script Cache for repeated `client_request_id` values.
- `createBilling(dataObject)` is normalized before calling `autoGenerateBillingForJob`, so PWA `createBilling` no longer risks passing `[object Object]` as the job id.
- IndexedDB offline queue now normalizes write records, auto-adds missing `client_request_id`, and replays through `callApi` instead of `callAPI` to avoid re-queuing a failed replay.
- `error_boundary.js` no longer overrides the IndexedDB offline queue when `offline_db.js` is already loaded.
- Static guard now blocks regressions in write idempotency, offline replay, and backend idempotent handlers.

### Phase 53 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **96/100**. The foundation is now guarded at three levels: static/code relationship checks in scripts, protected API smoke from terminal, and a browser-side Runtime Self-Test available directly inside the app.
- Added `pwa/runtime_self_test.js` as the live browser health layer. It checks runtime config, auth/session state, public API health/version, menu contract, protected read smoke when a session token exists, service worker/cache state, and AI safety/telemetry signals.
- PC Dashboard Settings now embeds the Runtime Self-Test panel via `renderSettingsSection()` + `hydrateSettingsRuntimePanels()`.
- Mobile Profile now includes a `Runtime Self-Test` entry that opens a bottom-sheet modal, so field users can verify API/session/cache state without opening DevTools.
- `pwa/dashboard_pc.html` and `pwa/index.html` now load `runtime_self_test.js` with the central cache-bust version.
- `pwa/pwa_asset_manifest.js` now includes `runtime_self_test.js` for install/cache parity.
- `scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` now blocks releases where Mobile or PC forget to load the runtime self-test surface.
- Service worker cache bumped to `comphone-v5.18.18-write-smoke-20260507_1130` to force browsers off the previous integrity-audit bundle.

### Phase 51 Current Review (2026-05-07)
- Status score: **95/100**. Core runtime is usable, PC duplicate auth/navigation drift is removed, mobile menu pages now open without offline/runtime errors, quick action modals open correctly, route/API drift now has an automated index guard, and GAS `loginUser` -> `verifySession` token persistence is fixed at deployment `@545`.
- Mobile PWA now loads the central API client, API contract, auth guard, version config, service worker assets, and `mobile_glass.css`.
- Mobile login is generated by `pwa/auth.js`; it now uses the modern glass login shell and reads version/build from `version_config.js`.
- PC dashboard login was modernized and the production mock-login path was removed. PC login must use the real GAS `loginUser` action.
- PC dashboard runtime is consolidated in `pwa/dashboard_pc_core.js`; `pwa/dashboard_pc.html` must remain markup plus asset loading only.
- Mobile `ลูกค้าใหม่` quick action no longer depends on an unloaded external billing customer modal; `pwa/app_actions.js` now builds a local fallback form before calling `createCustomer`.
- `pwa/auth_guard.js` no longer contains redacted `***` role aliases, and static guard now blocks this regression.
- Auth storage is standardized on `localStorage['comphone_auth_session']` and user profile storage on `localStorage['comphone_user']`.
- Backend auth session storage is centralized in `clasp-ready/Auth.gs`; `loginUser`, `verifySession`, and `logoutUser` now share the same Script Properties / overflow-sheet session path.
- Mobile `billing`, `reports`, and `inventory` now have compatibility guards for modules that were originally written for the PC dashboard (`setActiveNav`, `main-content`, `topbar-title`, and inventory mount fallbacks).
- Mobile `openJob()` is restored as an alias to the actual `openNewJob()` quick action, so the "เปิดงาน" workflow opens its modal again.
- Mobile profile version badge now reads from `version_config.js` instead of the old hardcoded `v5.14.0-phase37` label.
- Mobile dashboard quick action now routes `stock` to the actual `inventory` page, removing a hidden dead route.
- Mobile More menu was expanded from the reduced 8-item shell into a grouped operational menu: daily work, CRM, inventory, PO, billing, attendance, warranty, portal, notifications, dashboard, reports, analytics, performance, revenue, tax, admin, and settings. Admin remains role-gated by `more-admin-btn`.
- Mobile `goPage()` no longer redirects real pages such as dashboard, analytics, performance, revenue, and tax away from their own page containers.
- Mobile now stores the last active page in `localStorage['comphone_last_mobile_page']`, restores it on next launch, handles browser Back by closing sheets/modals or returning to Home before leaving, and warns before accidental unload on active work pages/offline queue.
- PC dashboard now stores `localStorage['comphone_last_pc_section']`, restores the last active section after login/session restore, confirms logout, and uses a scroll-contained sidebar grouped by workflow: Main, Jobs/Inventory, Finance, Reports, System.
- `scripts/build_code_index.js` now builds a local SocratiCode-lite map of PWA assets, routes, functions, API calls, GAS functions, router actions, public actions, dependency impact, workflow coverage, orphan/deprecated script candidates, and route risks. Generated reports are `test_reports/code_index_latest.json` and `test_reports/code_index_summary_latest.md`; both must stay uncommitted.
- `scripts/system_integrity_audit.js` now builds the production relationship matrix for Mobile and PC menus: menu -> route/page/section -> renderer function -> loaded JS file -> API contract actions -> GAS handlers -> AI lock/telemetry. Generated reports are `test_reports/system_integrity_latest.json` and `test_reports/system_integrity_latest.md`; both must stay uncommitted.
- `scripts/regression-guard.sh` now runs the System Integrity Audit after the code index so broken menu/renderer/container relationships block release before deployment.
- PC CRM route alignment fixed: sidebar `loadSection('crm')` now matches `#section-crm` and `#crm-content` instead of the legacy `section-customers` id.
- Service worker cache was bumped to `comphone-v5.18.18-write-smoke-20260507_1030` to force browsers off stale assets.
- BLUEPRINT is the source of truth. Old Hermes/SocratiCode notes below are historical unless explicitly marked current here.

### Current Validation Evidence
| Check | Latest Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `node --check pwa/auth.js` | PASS | Auth runtime parses after corrupted constants were restored. |
| `node scripts/pwa_static_guard.js` | PASS | Confirms cache/version alignment, API client loading, protected auth invariants, no production mock login. |
| `node scripts/build_code_index.js` | PASS | PWA JS=79, GAS=88, API actions=40, menu routes=20, workflows=5, risks none; emits JSON + Markdown intelligence reports. |
| `bash scripts/regression-guard.sh` | PASS | CI guard updated to current PC dashboard architecture and now includes code index validation. |
| Login + `verifySession` | PASS | Fresh `admin` login returns a token that verifies immediately on GAS `@545`. Token value is not stored in repo/docs. |
| `node scripts/pwa_api_smoke.js` | PASS protected | `health`, `getVersion`, `getDashboardData`, `listCustomers`, `inventoryOverview`, `listPurchaseOrders`, `getReportData`, and `getSecurityStatus` OK with fresh session token. |
| Local Mobile UI Audit | PASS | Login/session home, Jobs, CRM, Inventory, PO, Billing, Reports, Attendance, Warranty, Profile, `openJob` modal, and `addCustomer` modal open without offline/runtime errors. |
| Local PC UI Audit | PASS | Dashboard, Jobs, PO, Inventory, Billing, Warranty, Revenue, Tax, CRM, Attendance, Reports, Analytics, and Settings sections switch without runtime errors. |
| GitHub push | PASS | Latest review baseline reached `origin/main` via HTTPS after SSH key push failed. |

### 0-100 Health Review
| Area | Score | Status | Reason |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Runtime config/version/cache | 94 | Strong | Central PWA config and service worker cache are aligned at `v5.18.27-vision-preview-line-router`; auxiliary/archival pages still need cleanup. |
| Mobile PWA auth/login | 94 | Strong | Modern login, session restore, menu pages, billing/reports/inventory adapters, and quick-action modals pass local UI audit. |
| PC dashboard auth/login | 92 | Strong | Runtime is consolidated in `dashboard_pc_core.js`; core sections switch cleanly in local UI audit. |
| API contract/backend availability | 92 | Strong | Fresh login, verifySession, and required protected smoke pass against production GAS @545. |
| Menu/workflow confidence | 94 | Strong | Mobile More menu is restored to the full operational map, read-only menu APIs pass, PC/Mobile menu navigation passes local UI audit, open-job/customer modals open, and route drift is now checked by `build_code_index.js`; destructive writes still need staging validation. |
| Security posture | 88 | Good | Secrets are not stored in repo, public whitelist was hardened earlier, static guard protects key/auth drift, and session persistence no longer depends on unread overflow writes. |
| Documentation/source-of-truth hygiene | 70 | Needs cleanup | BLUEPRINT still has historical Phase 30-38 content, old version mentions, and external Hermes/SocratiCode claims that must be marked archival or moved out. |
| Overall | **95/100** | Stable | Base is stable enough to continue feature work; next phase should validate write workflows in staging and polish high-use screens. |

### Remaining Cleanup / Watchlist
| Priority | Item | Current Risk | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Done | Auth session persistence | `loginUser` returned a token that `verifySession` could not find when session writes overflowed away from Script Properties. | Fixed in `clasp-ready/Auth.gs`; deployed to GAS `@545`; protected smoke now passes. |
| Done | PC dashboard duplicate runtime logic | Resolved in `v5.18.7-authguard`. | Keep static guard enforcing one `_doLogin` and no inline core functions in `dashboard_pc.html`. |
| Done | Mobile menu/runtime recovery | Billing/Reports used PC-only `setActiveNav`, Inventory had no mobile loader, Profile showed stale version, and `openJob()` alias was missing. | Fixed in `v5.18.9-ui-menu`; local mobile UI audit passes. |
| Done | Route/API intelligence guard | Legacy `stock` quick action pointed to a missing mobile page and future drift had no fast detector. | Fixed in `v5.18.27-vision-preview-line-router`; run `node scripts/build_code_index.js` before release. |
| Done | Code Intelligence Layer v2 | Future agents needed a compact impact map instead of rereading the full repo. | Added dependency graph, workflow map, orphan classification, and Markdown summary output to `scripts/build_code_index.js`. |
| Done | System Integrity Audit Layer | Menu bugs could hide across route/page/renderer/API/container layers. | Added `scripts/system_integrity_audit.js`; regression guard now reports PC/Mobile menu matrix and AI workflow lock/telemetry status. |
| Done | Mobile menu map recovery | Operational pages existed but were hidden from the reduced More menu, and several pages were redirected away before loading. | Fixed in `v5.18.27-vision-preview-line-router`; full grouped menu restored and real pages can load directly. |
| Done | Navigation continuity | Mobile/PC did not reliably reopen the last working page and accidental Back/close/logout could interrupt work. | Fixed in `v5.18.27-vision-preview-line-router`; mobile and PC persist current page/section and add accidental-exit safeguards. |
| P1 | Destructive write-flow validation | Core gated write smoke now covers create customer, open job, safe job note/status, create billing, idempotent replay, read-back, and cleanup lifecycle. Payment/LINE/inventory transfer writes still require staging-only validation. | Run staging write smoke with `COMPHONE_WRITE_SMOKE=1` only against a safe dataset, then extend to payment/offline replay under explicit staging gates. |
| P1 | Auxiliary pages have old fallback versions | `executive_dashboard.html`, `monitoring_dashboard.html`, `system_graph.html`, some scripts still mention old versions. | Either align them to `version_config.js` or mark/archive them if unused. |
| P2 | BLUEPRINT historical sections are noisy | Old Hermes/SocratiCode claims and v5.9/v5.5 notes can mislead future agents. | Move old phases into an archive section and keep only current rules at the top. |
| Done | API contract version label says partial | `pwa/api_contract.js` now reports `2026-05-07.phase65-line-command-center` and is validated by API smoke/code index. | Keep contract changes tied to `scripts/pwa_api_smoke.js` and `scripts/build_code_index.js`. |
| P2 | Service worker/browser cache UX | Existing users may still hold old SW until refresh/update cycle finishes. | Add visible "update available/reload" prompt and a cache status indicator in Admin Health. |

### Tooling Reality Check
- **SocratiCode is not available in this Codex session.** Treat any SocratiCode/Hermes MCP instructions below as historical notes from another agent environment unless that tool is explicitly installed and callable.
- Current Codex verification uses local file analysis, PowerShell, Git, static guards, smoke scripts, and optional browser automation.

### Secret Handling Rule
- Do not store live secret/token/key values in this repository or in BLUEPRINT.md.
- BLUEPRINT.md records key names, storage locations, owners, and redacted/configured status only.
- Live secrets must stay in GAS Script Properties, GitHub Secrets, Cloudflare Secrets, or local environment variables.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Semantic + keyword search across entire codebase (250 files, 1,710 chunks)
  - Code dependency graph (imports, dependents, circular detection)
  - Impact analysis (blast radius) before refactoring
  - Context artifacts search (API specs, database schemas, infra configs)
  - Auto-update via file watcher (incremental indexing)
- **Usage:** All code-related queries in development phase should prioritize SocratiCode tools (`mcp_socraticode_codebase_search`, etc.)
- **Status:** ✅ Fully operational (Qdrant + Ollama managed containers)

## 7. Security Invariants (Frozen)

### 7.1 Auth & Access Control
- **PIN-based Login** — Fast authentication for mobile
- **Role-based UI** — OWNER / ADMIN / TECH / VIEWER
- **Session Token** — Server-side validation via `verifySession()`
- **17 Protected Actions** — Require auth token (billing, AI, backup, etc.)

### 7.2 Execution Security
- **Zero-Bypass GAS** — All API calls through `AI_EXECUTOR` + `GAS_EXECUTE`
- **Execution Lock** — `execution_lock.js` forbids direct GAS calls
- **One-time Approval Tokens** — 3000ms TTL, consumed on use
- **Rate Limiter v2** — 60 req/min per identity (CacheService hash)
- **LINE Signature Verification** — Hard-fail for invalid webhooks

### 7.3 Architecture Freeze (PHMP v1)
- **No architecture changes** without impact audit
- **Security invariants are immutable** — no bypass, no disable
- **Hotfixes** must branch from freeze tag, include regression tests
- **All new features** must pass staging validation

---

## 8. Deploy Pipeline

### 8.1 Deploy Script (`deploy_all.sh`)

```bash
# 1. Reconstruct ~/.clasprc.json from CLASP_TOKEN env var
# 2. Push GAS code: clasp push --force
# 3. Deploy new version: clasp deploy → capture URL
# 4. Update gas_config.js with new URL
# 5. Push to GitHub: git push origin main
# 6. Sync to Google Drive (OAuth2, no Service Account)
```

### 8.2 Environment Variables (Required)

| Variable | 用途 |
|----------|------|
| `CLASP_TOKEN` | สร้าง `~/.clasprc.json` สำหรับ clasp push |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth2 สำหรับ Drive sync |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth2 สำหรับ Drive sync |
| `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth2 สำหรับ Drive sync |

### 8.3 GitHub Pages Auto-Deploy
- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch (paths: `pwa/**`, `memory/session.md`)
- **Action:** `auto-deploy.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Result:** Files served from repo root — PWA accessible at `https://comphone.github.io/comphone-superapp/pwa/`
- **Important:** GitHub Pages serves from repo root. PWA is at `/comphone-superapp/pwa/` (NOT `/comphone-superapp/`). All paths in code MUST include `/pwa/`.


## 8.4 Validation Commands (Current Mandatory Checks)

```powershell
# Static frontend/backend contract guard
node scripts\pwa_static_guard.js

# Critical PC/mobile menu journey guard
node scripts\pwa_menu_journey_audit.js

# UI write and surface contract guards
node scripts\pwa_ui_write_contract.js
node scripts\pwa_ui_surface_audit.js

# Code intelligence / route drift guard
node scripts\build_code_index.js

# Public + required protected API smoke
$env:COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN='YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN'
node scripts\pwa_api_smoke.js

# Optional API smoke
$env:COMPHONE_SMOKE_OPTIONAL='1'
$env:COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN='YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN'
node scripts\pwa_api_smoke.js

# Read-only business workflow smoke
$env:COMPHONE_AUTH_TOKEN='YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN'
node scripts\pwa_workflow_smoke.js
```

Latest local reports are generated under `test_reports/*_latest.json` and are intentionally ignored by Git.

## 9. Configuration Rules

### 9.1 GAS Script Properties (49/50)
- Max 50 properties per script
- Property Guard monitors usage
- High-frequency data → dedicated Spreadsheet (not Script Properties)
- **RULE:** Never exceed 50 — system will reject writes

### 9.2 Service Worker
| **Version:** `CACHE_VERSION = 'comphone-v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening-20260516_0845'`
- **Timeout:** 15 seconds for API/network fallback
- **Strategies:** Cache First (static) | Network First (API) | Network Only (webhook)
- **Offline Queue:** IndexedDB `comphone_offline` v2 (action_queue, data_cache, queue)
- **Activation Rule:** SW sends `SW_ACTIVATED`; it must not force navigate/reload clients during activate.
- **Update Rule:** reload is gated by explicit user update acceptance through `pwa_install.js`.

### 9.3 Version Synchronization
All these MUST match on deploy:

| Surface | File | Key |
|---------|------|-----|
| SW Cache | `sw.js` | `CACHE_VERSION = 'comphone-v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening-20260516_0845'` |
| PWA Version | `version_config.js` | `APP_VERSION = 'v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening'` |
| Build Timestamp | `version_config.js` | `BUILD_TIMESTAMP = '20260516_0845'` |
| GAS Deploy | `gas_config.js` / `Config.gs` | Production deploy URL @614 |
| API Contract | `api_contract.js` | `2026-05-07.phase65-line-command-center` |

---

## 10. Known Issues & Resolutions

### ✅ Recently Fixed (2026-04-23)

### 🔴 Audit Summary (2026-05-02 Workspace Check)

**Overall Score: 90/100** ✅ NEARLY PRODUCTION-READY

| Module | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| GAS backend health/config | 95% | Healthy, version correct, API contract fixed |
| Mobile shell/navigation | 90% | Line-number bug fixed, duplicates removed |
| Mobile Reports/advanced | 85% | Core features complete, some sections pending |
| PC dashboard | 75% | Login issues found, needs cache clear/re-test |
| Frontend/backend contract | 95% | Cross-check complete, whitelist updated |
| Static guard/deploy guard | 90% | Passes, API contract aligned |
| BLUEPRINT accuracy | 95% | Updated to Phase 36, versions synced |
| Drive sync | ⚠️ | Timeout after 30+ files, clean run pending |

**What PASSED:**
- ✅ GAS health: status healthy, version 5.13.0-phase36
- ✅ node scripts/pwa_static_guard.js passes
- ✅ JS หลักฝั่ง mobile parse ผ่าน
- ✅ line-number bug NNN| เหลือ 0
- ✅ git working tree clean (at time of audit)
- ✅ API contract cross-check complete (12 functions added)
- ✅ Duplicate modules removed (inventory.js, billing_ui.js)
- ✅ UX patterns verified (loading, error, mobile responsive)

**Historical P0 Critical (superseded by current @609 baseline):**
1. Fixed: API contract drift (whitelist updated, functions added)
2. Fixed: Duplicate modules removed (inventory.js, billing_ui.js)
3. Fixed: Static guard passes with updated references
4. Fixed: PC Dashboard & Mobile PWA login/session/cache recovery is validated by browser smoke, live public smoke, and protected runbook when token is supplied.
5. Watch only: Drive sync is not the production code source of truth; GitHub `main` + GAS @609 are current.

**P1 High (Should fix):**
1. ✅ Fixed: Version sync (Phase 36, v5.13.0-phase36)
2. ✅ Fixed: Frontend action cross-check complete
3. ✅ Fixed: Static guard verified with updated references
4. Active watch: Monitor GAS logs/performance after @609, especially write-smoke cleanup paths.

**P2 Medium (Future hardening):**
1. Keep invokeFunctionByNameV55_ whitelist hardening covered by regression guard.
2. Continue separating read/write/admin action registries through API contract and RouterSplit.
3. Continue reducing duplicate modules only when a current guard or runtime issue proves the risk.

| ปัญหา | สาเหตุ | แก้ไข |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Mobile "เชื่อมต่อไม่ได้" | auth.js + api_client.js ใช้ POST → GAS 302 redirect ฆ่า body | เปลี่ยน POST → GET ทั้งหมด (auth.js, api_client.js, error_boundary.js) |
| PWA Path สับสน | GitHub Pages serve จาก repo root → PWA อยู่ที่ `/pwa/` ไม่ใช่ root | คง path `/comphone-superapp/pwa/` (ไม่ตัด /pwa/ ออก) |
| Version เก่า v5.5 | index.html hardcode "v5.5" | แก้เป็น v5.6.6 |
| SW IndexedDB error | DB version mismatch (SW v2, offline_db v1) | Bump offline_db.js to v2, sync stores |
| gas_config.js URL ผิด | Deploy จับ URL ผิด deployment | แก้ URL ตรง |
| AI Validation 12/16 fail | Recursive test() bug + typeof mismatch | แก้ validation script, add context-aware skip |
| Dashboard "กำลังพัฒนา" | loadSection() แสดง placeholder | เปลี่ยนเป็น live data loaders (11 sections) |
| SW timeout 3s | API ใช้เวลา 11s แต่ timeout 3s | เพิ่มเป็น 15s |
| POST → 405 error (PC) | GAS redirect POST → GET (302) | เปลี่ยนเป็น GET ทั้งหมด (dashboard_pc.html, executive_dashboard.html) |
| system_graph_data.js 404 | ไฟล์ไม่มี | สร้าง stub file |
| 10 ไฟล์ blueprint ซ้ำซ้อน | 47 ไฟล์เอกสารกระจัดกระจาย | รวมเป็น BLUEPRINT.md ไฟล์เดียว + ลบ 10 ไฟล์ซ้ำ |
| Google Drive backup เก่า | SA ไม่มี write quota | ใช้ OAuth2 upload + ลบ backup เก่า |
| **Login fail (Static Hosting)** | `GAS_EXECUTE()` ต้องใช้ `google.script.run` ซึ่งไม่มีบน GitHub Pages | เพิ่ม fetch fallback ใน `execution_lock.js` + `Router.gs` doGet routeActionV55 |
| **GAS doGet ไม่รองรับ loginUser** | `doGet()` hardcode เฉพาะ ~15 actions, ไม่มี loginUser | เพิ่ม `routeActionV55()` fallback สำหรับ actions ที่ไม่ตรง hardcoded list |
| **Dashboard ช้า ~11s** | `getDashboardData()` อ่านซ้ำ 17 ครั้ง (DBJOBS 7x, DB_INVENTORY 3x) | Switch frontend เป็น `getDashboardBundle()` (single-pass + 90s cache) |
| **Inventory UI placeholder** | `renderInventorySection()` แสดงแค่ lowStock count | สร้าง full CRUD UI: 4 KPI, search/filter, table, modals (add/edit/delete/transfer/PO) |
| **deploy_all.sh clasp timeout** | clasp push timeout ไม่มี fallback | เพิ่ม Apps Script API fallback + 60s timeout |
| **Mobile line-number UI bug** | Prefixes (121|, 122|) ใน PWA assets | Fixed in commit af5dbc9 (Codex patch) |
| **Codex/Hermes audit** | Read-only audit of BLUEPRINT.md (2026-05-02) | Compliance 90%, gaps identified, roadmap updated |


### Historical Audit Findings Closed By Current Baseline

| Historical Finding | Current Resolution |
|---|---|
| PC Dashboard parse/runtime breakage | Closed by browser smoke, static guard, and current dashboard split runtime. |
| callGas/callApi mismatch | Closed by API client compatibility and smoke/static guard coverage. |
| GAS doGet auth bypass/open fallback | Closed by Router auth gate, whitelist hardening, and regression guard. |
| Accounting payload/auth mapping | No longer a release blocker; protected routes and current contract checks guard high-risk calls. |
| Version mismatch v5.13/v5.9 notes | Superseded by current PWA v5.18.34 and GAS @609 snapshot above. |

| รายการ | สถานะ | หมายเหตุ |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Browser cache | ⚠️ | ผู้ใช้ต้อง Hard Refresh หลัง deploy |
| Google Drive SA quota | ⚠️ | SA ไม่มี write quota — ต้องใช้ OAuth2 สำหรับ upload |
| Inventory.gs decomposition | ✅ Phase 31 | แยกเป็น 6 modules (InventoryReservation, StockCheck, CRUD, Transfer, PO, ReorderAI) — 1,469L → 22L |
| BillingManager.gs decomposition | ✅ Phase 31 | แยกเป็น 3 modules (BillingCore, Payment, Export) — 958L → 22L |
| DriveSync retry | ✅ Phase 31 | SharedContext.gs v1.1.0 เพิ่ม syncWithRetry_() exponential backoff 3 retries |
| Analytics Index | ✅ Phase 31 | AnalyticsIndex.gs (369L) TTL cache + searchWithIndex <2s query |
| Self-Improving QA Loop | ✅ Phase 31 | 7-Check Protocol (Hermes sub-agent) → Master → Deploy loop |
| Anomaly Detection baseline | ⏳ Phase 33 | รอ telemetry 14 วันจาก Phase 2E (เริ่มเก็บข้อมูลแล้ว) |
| Time/Attendance UI | ✅ Phase 32 | เพิ่มรายงานสรุปรายเดือน/รายปี + PDF Export ใน attendance_section.js |
| Report Module UI | ✅ Phase 32 | สร้าง reports.js ใหม่ (4 ประเภทรายงาน: Attendance, Jobs, Billing, Inventory) |
| Automated Unit Testing | ✅ Phase 32 | สร้าง api_test_framework.js - ทดสอบ API อัตโนมัติ |
| **Phase 33: Predictive Analytics** | ⏳ | วิเคราะห์แนวโน้มยอดขาย/สต็อก, พยากรณ์ความต้องการลูกค้า |
| **Phase 33: Advanced AI Features** | ⏳ | พัฒนา AI ทำนายการบริการ, แนะนำสินค้า/บริการอัจฉริยะ |
| Blueprint reconciliation | ✅ | File map, versions, phase labels synced 2026-04-29 |
| Drive Sync timeout | Watch only | GitHub main and GAS @609 are source of truth; GDrive sync is optional backup/ops, not a production code blocker. |
| H1 Security Hardening | OK guarded | invokeFunctionByNameV55_ whitelist/auth behavior is covered by regression guard; continue monitoring on route changes. |
| Monitor GAS logs/performance | Active watch | Continue after @609, especially cleanup/write-smoke paths and dashboard latency. |

## 13. Development Rules

### 13.1 Operational Principles
1. **ใช้ข้อมูลจริงเป็นฐาน** — ไม่สร้างข้อมูลสมมติ
2. **ไม่ทำงานแบบเงียบ** — error ต้องบันทึกและแจ้งเหตุ
3. **ทำงานต่อเนื่องจนจบงาน** — ไม่ค้างกลางทาง
4. **ความถูกต้องสำคัญกว่าความสวยงาม** — โดยเฉพาะข้อมูลการเงิน
5. **รองรับการขยายตัวแบบค่อยเป็นค่อยไป**

### 13.2 Code Rules
- ❌ **ห้าม** เรียก GAS โดยตรง — ต้องผ่าน `callGas()` หรือ `AI_EXECUTOR`
- ❌ **ห้าม** ใช้ Service Account สำหรับ Drive — ใช้ OAuth2 เท่านั้น
- ❌ **ห้าม** hardcode URL — ใช้ `gas_config.js` เป็น single source
- ❌ **ห้าม** เกิน 50 Script Properties — ใช้ Spreadsheet แทน
- ✅ **ต้อง** sync version ทุก surface หลัง deploy
- ✅ **ต้อง** ใช้ GET สำหรับ API calls (GAS redirect ฆ่า POST body)
- ✅ **ต้อง** timeout 15s สำหรับ API calls (GAS cold start)
- ✅ **ต้อง** error logging ทุก API failure

### 13.3 Deploy Rules (PHMP v1)
- **Freeze tag:** `v5.9.0-phase31-freeze`
- **Hotfix branch:** `hotfix/{YYYYMMDD}-{description}`
- **No direct push to main** for architecture changes
- **Regression test required** before merge

## 14.1 Secret / API Key Inventory (Redacted)

> Security rule: this table records key names and storage locations only. Never commit live secret values.

| Key / Secret | Storage | Runtime Consumer | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DB_SS_ID` | GAS Script Properties | all GAS data modules | configured | Spreadsheet ID is operational identifier, not an auth secret. |

## 16. API Contract

### Request Pattern (เปลี่ยนจาก POST เป็น GET — Phase 26.4)
```
GET {GAS_URL}?action=xxx&token=xxx&param1=val1
```

### Response Pattern
```json
{ "success": true, "data": {...}, "message": "optional" }
```

### Frontend Call Pattern
```js
// Mobile PWA (app.js)
async function callAPI(action, params = {}) {
  const url = GAS_URL + '?' + new URLSearchParams({ action, ...params });
  const res = await fetch(url);
  return res.json();
}

// PC Dashboard (dashboard_pc.html)
async function callGas(action, params) {
  const baseUrl = localStorage.getItem('comphone_gas_url') || GAS_URL;
  const qs = new URLSearchParams({ action, ...params }).toString();
  const r = await fetch(baseUrl + '?' + qs);
  return r.json();
}
```

### Auth
- ส่ง `token` (Session ID) ในทุก request ที่ต้องการสิทธิ์
- Token ได้จาก `loginUser` action → `verifySession()` ฝั่ง server

## 19. Design Rationale

### ทำไมใช้ SPA (ไม่ใช่ Multi-page)?
- ลดภาระ GAS ในการโหลดหน้าใหม่
- UI ตอบสนองเร็ว (Snappy) คล้าย Native App
- รองรับการขยายเมนูในอนาคตได้ง่าย

### ทำไม Inventory 3 ชั้น?
- **คลังหลัก (Main):** รับของเข้าและจัดเก็บ
- **หน้าร้าน (Site):** ขายหรือใช้งานหน้าร้าน
- **รถช่าง (Van):** ช่างพกติดรถไปหน้างาน
- สะท้อนการทำงานจริงของธุรกิจรับเหมาติดตั้ง

### ทำไม PromptPay เป็น payment rail หลัก?
- เหมาะกับงานบริการในไทย
- เชื่อมกับการสร้าง QR ได้ง่าย
- ทำให้ flow สถานะ 10→11 (รอชำระ→ชำระแล้ว) มี automation ชัดเจน

### ทำไมเปลี่ยน POST เป็น GET?
- GAS redirect POST → GET (302 Found) ทำให้ body หาย
- GET with query params ไม่ได้รับผลกระทบจาก redirect
- Dashboard data fetch ใช้ GET ได้ (ไม่ sensitive)

### ทำไม timeout 15 วินาที?
- GAS cold start ใช้เวลา 5-10 วินาที
- เดิมตั้ง 3 วินาที → API timeout ก่อนได้ response
- 15 วินาทีครอบคลุม worst case

## 21. Architectural Decisions Log

| # | การตัดสินใจ | เหตุผล |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | ยึด Router กลาง (Router.gs) | ดูแลง่าย, single entry point สำหรับ web app deployment |
| 2 | ใช้ Google Sheets ต่อ | สอดคล้องระบบเดิม, ลดเวลา migration, เพิ่ม dynamic header mapping |
| 3 | เปลี่ยนรูปถ่ายเป็น data pipeline | รูป不再是แค่หลักฐาน แต่เป็นตัวขับการประเมินคุณภาพงาน |
| 4 | ยึด state machine เป็นแกนกลาง | validation, audit log, billing trigger, stock reservation ผูกกันเป็นระบบ |
| 5 | 3-layer inventory | สะท้อนการทำงานจริง (ร้าน + ภาคสนาม) |
| 6 | PromptPay เป็น payment rail | เหมาะไทย, QR ง่าย, automation ชัด |
| 7 | Multi-channel notification | LINE + Telegram + Email (อนาคต) ตาม role |
| 8 | GET แทน POST | GAS redirect ฆ่า POST body |
| 9 | SW timeout 15s | GAS cold start 5-10s |
| 10 | OAuth2 แทน Service Account | Drive quota issues with SA |

### ✅ Completed Work (Phase 30-31)

| งาน | สถานะ | รายละเอียด |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Version Alignment** | ✅ เสร็จ | แก้ไข 4 ไฟล์ให้ใช้เวอร์ชันเดียวกัน (v5.9.0-phase31) |
| **Centralized Versioning** | ✅ เสร็จ | สร้าง `version_config.js` เป็นแหล่งข้อมูลเดียว |
| **Cache Buster** | ✅ เสร็จ | เพิ่ม timestamp parameter + comment ในทุกไฟล์ PWA |
| **Missing Files Fix** | ✅ เสร็จ | เพิ่ม `mobile_shared.js`, `favicon.ico` |
| **gas_config.js Loading** | ✅ เสร็จ | เพิ่มใน `index.html` ก่อน `</head>` |
| **API Fallback URL** | OK Done | Aligned to `gas_config.js` / GAS @609 in `api_client.js` |
| **Dashboard Modernization (Phase 31)** | ✅ เสร็จ | เพิ่ม 5 Chart.js v4 functions + CHARTS object |
| **AI LINE Agent (3 บทบาท)** | ✅ Backend ready | สร้าง `AILinePrompts.gs` + อัปเดต `LineBot.gs` (รอ Group IDs จริง) |
| **Dependency Checklist** | ✅ เสร็จ | เพิ่มใน BLUEPRINT Section 2.5 |
| **GitHub Push** | ✅ เสร็จ | 5 commits (`b8ccd2f`, `8695600`, `38a5ed5`, `0f68e2f`, `c7cca60`) |

### Current Work Register (2026-04-29)

| งาน | สถานะ | อุปสรรค |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Login / Splash / Menu Recovery** | OK **resolved in current baseline** | `api_client.js`, auth guard, service worker activation, menu restore, and API contract smoke are stable at GAS @614 / cache `comphone-v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening-20260516_0845`. |
| **AI LINE Agent Testing** | ❌ **รอ Group IDs** | ต้องเปลี่ยน Placeholder Group IDs ใน `AILinePrompts.gs` (บรรทัด 169-173) เป็น LINE Group ID จริง |
| **Dashboard PC Runtime Baseline** | OK **validated** | PC dashboard uses central version/GAS/API config and no longer clears session storage during boot. Continue visual/UX QA after each feature batch. |
| **Google Drive Sync** | ❌ **Failed** | `SharedContext.gs` timeout (ต้อง retry) |
| **Service Worker Stability** | OK **stabilized** | SW activation no longer forces navigation/reload; updates are gated by user-accepted refresh via `pwa_install.js`. |

### 🗄️ Backup Status (28 เมษายน 2569 — 15:05)

| สถานที่ | สถานะ | รายละเอียด |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **GitHub Repository** | OK current | `main` branch latest verified baseline commit `4512c5f` before this BLUEPRINT update. |
| **Google Drive (Code)** | Needs retry | `SharedContext.gs` sync timeout remains a follow-up item; GitHub is the current code source of truth. |
| **Google Drive (Backups)** | ✅ **มี** | `backups/` folder — 6 ไฟล์ `.tar.gz` (2026-04-28) |
| **Local Backups** | ✅ **ครบ** | `/mnt/c/Users/Server/comphone-superapp/backups/*.tar.gz` |
| **Session Memory** | Superseded by BLUEPRINT | Current runtime/API/key baseline is now recorded in this BLUEPRINT update. |

### Next Steps (Priority Order - Current Baseline)

1. **HIGH: CI smoke automation** - active: auto-deploy and regression guards run static, smoke, workflow, Vision, UI, and write-smoke safety checks.
2. **HIGH: Staging write-flow validation** - next: run the gated write smoke against a staging dataset, then add payment/offline replay under explicit staging confirmations.
3. **MEDIUM: Google Drive Sync retry and timeout tuning** - optional ops follow-up; GitHub main and GAS @609 are current source of truth.
4. **MEDIUM: AI LINE Agent testing** - run controlled room-routing tests only with real group IDs and non-customer test messages.
5. **LOW: UX polish for high-use screens** - continue Dashboard PC/mobile refinements after protected read/write guards stay green.

### Current Phase 30 Stability Update (2026-04-29)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA Mobile Runtime** | OK Stable | Login, auth restore, menu visibility, service worker activation, and API client loading are aligned. |
| **PC Dashboard Runtime** | OK Stable | Reads central config/version, keeps session storage intact, and shares the API contract baseline. |
| **API Contract** | OK Stable | Required, optional, and read-only workflow smoke checks pass against GAS @609. |
| **Offline / Queue UX** | OK Improved | Queue flush, health view, and observability states are visible from Admin > Health. |
| **Remaining Professional Work** | NEXT | CI automation is active; next risk is staging-only write/payment/offline replay validation plus UX polish for high-use screens. |

### Phase 67 Source Alignment Update (2026-05-07)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **GAS Source of Truth** | OK Hardened | Root GAS files and `clasp-ready/` are aligned for `Router.gs`, `Auth.gs`, `Config.gs`, `RouterSplit.gs`, `LineCommandCenter.gs`, and `VisionPipeline.gs`. |
| **Deploy Guard** | OK Hardened | `scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` now treats all aligned GAS files as blocking checks instead of warning-only drift. |
| **Auth Session Store** | OK Hardened | Session persistence combines PropertiesService, safeSetProperty/PROP_OVERFLOW, and CacheService fallback. Login returns a token only after a session is stored. |
| **Router Security** | OK Aligned | Root `Router.gs` now includes the same sensitive-action auth gates, login alias, and dynamic invocation allowlist as the deploy-ready source. |
| **AI Vision Pipeline** | OK Aligned | Root `VisionPipeline.gs` now includes the Phase 61-64 review queue, field context, suggestion preview/execute, and timeline integration helpers from deploy-ready source. |

#### Phase 67 Notes
- No real secrets are stored in this repository. Runtime secrets such as LINE tokens, Gemini keys, GitHub tokens, and session tokens must remain in Apps Script Properties, GitHub Actions secrets, or a local ignored `.env` file.
- Production deploy paths must pass `node scripts/gas_source_alignment.js` before deployment to prevent root/deploy-ready drift.
- Next recommended work: staging-safe write-flow validation for job/customer/billing/POS actions, followed by AI Vision end-to-end browser QA.

### Phase 68 Write-Flow Validation Update (2026-05-07)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend Deployment** | OK Deployed | GAS deployment `@562` points to `v5.18.16-write-flow-validation`. |
| **PWA Runtime** | OK Updated | Frontend cache/version is `v5.18.31-write-flow-validation` with build `20260507_2330`. |
| **API Payload Contract** | OK Hardened | `callApi()` now serializes object/array query payloads as JSON so complex write payloads do not become `[object Object]`. |
| **Write Idempotency** | OK Aligned | `createCustomer`, `openJob`, and `createBilling` use `client_request_id` replay protection across root and `clasp-ready` source. |
| **Write Smoke** | OK Validated | `scripts/pwa_write_smoke.js` validates create customer, open job, create billing, idempotent replay, and read-back verification. PO write remains behind a separate safety gate. |
| **Source Alignment Guard** | OK Hardened | Alignment guard now blocks drift for `CustomerManager.gs`, `JobsHandler.gs`, and `InventoryPO.gs` in addition to previous critical GAS files. |

#### Phase 68 Validation
- Protected API smoke passed for dashboard, CRM, inventory, PO, reports, vision, LINE command center, and admin.
- Real write smoke passed for customer/job/billing with read-back verification.
- Regression guard passed with the existing non-blocking service worker cleanup warning.

### Phase 69 UI Write Contract Update (2026-05-08)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA Runtime** | OK Updated | Frontend cache/version is `v5.18.32-ui-write-contract` with build `20260508_0015`. |
| **Write Request IDs** | OK Hardened | `createWriteRequestId()` is available from the central API client, so PC and mobile write flows share the same request id pattern. |
| **PC CRM Write Flow** | OK Hardened | PC add-customer now sends `client_request_id` and `source=pc_crm`. |
| **PC Inventory/PO Write Flow** | OK Hardened | PC create-PO now sends `client_request_id`, `source=pc_inventory`, and structured `items` through the JSON-safe API client. |
| **Regression Guard** | OK Hardened | New `scripts/pwa_ui_write_contract.js` validates high-risk UI write flows and is included in the regression guard pack. |

#### Phase 69 Validation
- `scripts/pwa_ui_write_contract.js` passed.
- Protected API smoke passed against GAS `@562`.
- Regression guard passed with the existing non-blocking service worker cleanup warning.

### Phase 70 UI Surface Audit Update (2026-05-08)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **UI Surface Audit** | OK Added | New `scripts/pwa_ui_surface_audit.js` checks PC/mobile load order, modal handlers, scroll-safe modals, double-submit guards, and high-risk write button contracts. |
| **Regression Guard** | OK Hardened | Regression pack now runs both `pwa_ui_write_contract.js` and `pwa_ui_surface_audit.js`. |
| **CI Readiness** | OK Hardened | `pwa_ui_surface_audit.js` is listed as a required CI script. |
| **Pages Freshness** | OK Verified | GitHub Pages is serving `v5.18.32-ui-write-contract`, build `20260508_0015`, and GAS `@562`. |

#### Phase 70 Notes
- Browser-use plugin setup failed in this local session because its runtime could not write kernel assets. The fallback static/runtime audit layer was added so CI still catches UI contract drift until a browser engine is available.
- Remaining next step: install or repair a browser automation engine, then run visual click-through for PC/Mobile modals and screenshots.

### Phase 71 Menu Journey Reports Hardening Update (2026-05-08)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA Runtime** | OK Updated | Frontend cache/version is `v5.18.33-menu-journey-reports` with build `20260508_1030`. |
| **PC Reports Menu** | OK Fixed | `dashboard_pc.html` now loads `reports.js` before the legacy `section_reports.js` bridge, so PC Reports opens the real reports module instead of the old prototype surface. |
| **Reports Compatibility Bridge** | OK Hardened | `section_reports.js` is now only a compatibility bridge and no longer renders prototype/coming-soon buttons or empty report cards. |
| **Menu Journey Guard** | OK Added | New `scripts/pwa_menu_journey_audit.js` validates the priority operational journeys: Reports, service job, customer CRM, billing/payment, inventory/PO, and platform API contracts. |
| **Regression Guard / CI** | OK Hardened | `pwa_menu_journey_audit.js` is required by CI readiness and runs in the regression guard pack. |

#### Phase 71 Validation
- `node scripts/pwa_menu_journey_audit.js` passed with **100/100**.
- The next professional sequence is to continue menu-by-menu with real browser click-through once browser automation is available: Reports -> Open Job -> Customer -> Billing/Payment -> Inventory/PO -> AI Vision/LINE -> Admin Settings.

### Phase 72 Job Menu Hardening Update (2026-05-08)

| Workstream | Status | Current Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **PWA Runtime** | OK Updated | Frontend cache/version is `v5.18.34-job-menu-hardening` with build `20260513_2005`. |
| **PC Jobs Renderer** | OK Fixed | `renderJobsSection()` now returns HTML to `dashboard_pc_core.js` and no longer replaces `main-content` directly, preventing section/page replacement drift. |
| **PC Open Job Flow** | OK Added | PC Jobs now has a real open-job modal that calls `openJob` with `client_request_id`, `source=pc_dashboard_jobs`, required field validation, result feedback, and duplicate-click blocking. |
| **Menu Journey Guard** | OK Expanded | `scripts/pwa_menu_journey_audit.js` now validates PC jobs render contract, PC open-job modal wiring, and PC open-job double-submit guard. |

#### Phase 72 Validation
- `node --check pwa/section_jobs.js` passed.
- `node scripts/pwa_menu_journey_audit.js` passed with **100/100** and 22 checks.
